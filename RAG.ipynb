However, the identification of breast abnormalities, like masses, on mammographic images is not a trivial task, especially for dense breasts. In this paper we describe our novel mass detection process that includes three successive steps of enhancement, characterization and classification. The proposed enhancement system is based mainly on the analysis of the breast texture. First of all, a filtering step with morphological operators and soft thresholding is achieved. Then, we remove from the filtered breast region, all the details that may interfere with the eventual masses, including pectoral muscle and galactophorous tree. The pixels belonging to this tree will be interpolated and replaced by the average of the neighborhood. In the characterization process, measurement of the Gaussian density in the wavelet domain allows the segmentation of the masses. Finally, a comparative classification mechanism based on the Bayesian regularization back-propagation networks and ANFIS techniques is proposed. The tests were conducted on the MIAS database. The results showed the robustness of the proposed enhancement method.'),\n",

              " Document(page_content=\"BACKGROUND: Improved breast cancer risk assessment models are needed to enable personalized screening strategies that achieve better harm-to-benefit ratio based on earlier detection and better breast cancer outcomes than existing screening guidelines. Computational mammographic phenotypes have demonstrated a promising role in breast cancer risk prediction. With the recent exponential growth of computational efficiency, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, driven by the introduction of deep learning, has expanded the utility of imaging in predictive models. Consequently, AI-based imaging-derived data has led to some of the most promising tools for precision breast cancer screening. MAIN BODY: This review aims to synthesize the current state-of-the-art applications of AI in mammographic phenotyping of breast cancer risk. We discuss the fundamentals of AI and explore the computing advancements that have made AI-based image analysis essential in refining breast cancer risk assessment. Specifically, we discuss the use of data derived from digital mammography as well as digital breast tomosynthesis. Different aspects of breast cancer risk assessment are targeted including (a) robust and reproducible evaluations of breast density, a well-established breast cancer risk factor, (b) assessment of a woman's inherent breast cancer risk, and (c) identification of women who are likely to be diagnosed with breast cancers after a negative or routine screen due to masking or the rapid and aggressive growth of a tumor. Lastly, we discuss AI challenges unique to the computational analysis of mammographic imaging as well as future directions for this promising research field. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a useful reference for AI researchers investigating image-based breast cancer risk assessment while indicating key priorities and challenges that, if properly addressed, could accelerate the implementation of AI-assisted risk stratification to future refine and individualize breast cancer screening strategies.\"),\n",
              " Document(page_content='(Aim) Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the second most common cancer worldwide. With the rapid advancement of deep learning, the early stages of breast cancer development can be accurately detected by radiologists with the help of artificial intelligence systems. (Method) Based on mammographic imaging, a mainstream clinical breast screening technique, we present a diagnostic system for accurate classification of breast abnormalities based on ResNet-50. To improve the proposed model, we created a new data augmentation framework called SCDA (Scaling and Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization Data Augmentation). In its procedure, we first conduct the scaling operation to the original training set, followed by applying contrast limited adaptive histogram equalisation (CLAHE) to the scaled training set. By stacking the training set after SCDA with the original training set, we formed a new training set. The network trained by the augmented training set, was coined as ResNet-SCDA-50. Our system, which aims at a binary classification on mammographic images acquired from INbreast and MINI-MIAS, classifies masses, microcalcification as \"abnormal\", while normal regions are classified as \"normal\". (Results) We present the first attempt to use the image contrast enhancement method as the data augmentation method, resulting in an averaged 98.55 percent specificity and 92.83 percent sensitivity, which gives our best model an overall accuracy of 95.74 percent. (Conclusion) Our proposed method is effective in classifying breast abnormality.')]"

However, the identification of breast abnormalities, like masses, on mammographic images is not a trivial task, especially for dense breasts. In this paper we describe our novel mass detection process that includes three successive steps of enhancement, characterization and classification. The proposed enhancement system is based mainly on the analysis of the breast texture. First of all, a filtering step with morphological operators and soft thresholding is achieved. Then, we remove from the filtered breast region, all the details that may interfere with the eventual masses, including pectoral muscle and galactophorous tree. The pixels belonging to this tree will be interpolated and replaced by the average of the neighborhood. In the characterization process, measurement of the Gaussian density in the wavelet domain allows the segmentation of the masses. Finally, a comparative classification mechanism based on the Bayesian regularization back-propagation networks and ANFIS techniques is proposed. The tests were conducted on the MIAS database. The results showed the robustness of the proposed enhancement method.\n",

            "Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches have recently led to major performance steps in visual recognition tasks. However, only a few industrial applications are described in the literature. In this paper, an object detection application for visual quality evaluation of X-ray scatter grids is described and evaluated. To detect the small defects on the 4K input images, a sliding window approach is chosen. A special characteristic of the selected approach is the aggregation of overlapping prediction results by applying a 2D scalar field. The final system is able to detect 90% of the relevant defects, taking a precision score of 25% into account. A practical examination of the effectiveness elaborates the potential of the approach, improving the detection results of the inspection process by over 13%.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Improved breast cancer risk assessment models are needed to enable personalized screening strategies that achieve better harm-to-benefit ratio based on earlier detection and better breast cancer outcomes than existing screening guidelines. Computational mammographic phenotypes have demonstrated a promising role in breast cancer risk prediction. With the recent exponential growth of computational efficiency, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, driven by the introduction of deep learning, has expanded the utility of imaging in predictive models. Consequently, AI-based imaging-derived data has led to some of the most promising tools for precision breast cancer screening. MAIN BODY: This review aims to synthesize the current state-of-the-art applications of AI in mammographic phenotyping of breast cancer risk. We discuss the fundamentals of AI and explore the computing advancements that have made AI-based image analysis essential in refining breast cancer risk assessment. Specifically, we discuss the use of data derived from digital mammography as well as digital breast tomosynthesis. Different aspects of breast cancer risk assessment are targeted including (a) robust and reproducible evaluations of breast density, a well-established breast cancer risk factor, (b) assessment of a woman's inherent breast cancer risk, and (c) identification of women who are likely to be diagnosed with breast cancers after a negative or routine screen due to masking or the rapid and aggressive growth of a tumor. Lastly, we discuss AI challenges unique to the computational analysis of mammographic imaging as well as future directions for this promising research field. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a useful reference for AI researchers investigating image-based breast cancer risk assessment while indicating key priorities and challenges that, if properly addressed, could accelerate the implementation of AI-assisted risk stratification to future refine and individualize breast cancer screening strategies.\n",

            "(Aim) Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the second most common cancer worldwide. With the rapid advancement of deep learning, the early stages of breast cancer development can be accurately detected by radiologists with the help of artificial intelligence systems. (Method) Based on mammographic imaging, a mainstream clinical breast screening technique, we present a diagnostic system for accurate classification of breast abnormalities based on ResNet-50. To improve the proposed model, we created a new data augmentation framework called SCDA (Scaling and Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization Data Augmentation). In its procedure, we first conduct the scaling operation to the original training set, followed by applying contrast limited adaptive histogram equalisation (CLAHE) to the scaled training set. By stacking the training set after SCDA with the original training set, we formed a new training set. The network trained by the augmented training set, was coined as ResNet-SCDA-50. Our system, which aims at a binary classification on mammographic images acquired from INbreast and MINI-MIAS, classifies masses, microcalcification as \"abnormal\", while normal regions are classified as \"normal\". (Results) We present the first attempt to use the image contrast enhancement method as the data augmentation method, resulting in an averaged 98.55 percent specificity and 92.83 percent sensitivity, which gives our best model an overall accuracy of 95.74 percent. (Conclusion) Our proposed method is effective in classifying breast abnormality.\n",

We experienced psychogenic responses in the electrical cortical stimulation of two patients with intractable epilepsy. A sham stimulation was useful for differentiating pseudo-responses from real responses in the electrical cortical stimulation.

What about writing? Do people hold similar implicit theories about the nature of their writing ability? Furthermore, are these beliefs likely to influence students' response to a writing intervention? AIMS: We aimed to develop a scale to measure students' implicit theories of writing (pilot study) and to test whether these beliefs influence strategy-instruction effectiveness (intervention study). SAMPLE: In the pilot and intervention studies participated, respectively, 128 and 192 students (Grades 5-6). METHOD: Based on existing instruments that measure self-theories of intelligence, we developed the Implicit Theories of Writing (ITW) scale that was tested with the pilot sample. In the intervention study, 109 students received planning instruction based on the self-regulated strategy development model, whereas 83 students received standard writing instruction. Students were evaluated before, in the middle, and after instruction. RESULTS: ITW's validity was supported by piloting results and their successful cross-validation in the intervention study. In this, intervention students wrote longer and better texts than control students. Moreover, latent growth curve modelling showed that the more the intervention students conceived writing as a malleable skill, the more the quality of their texts improved. CONCLUSION: This research is of educational relevance because it provides a measure to evaluate students' implicit theories of writing and shows their impact on response to intervention.\n",

            "Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by social impairments, including inappropriate responses to affective stimuli and nonverbal cues, which may extend to poor face-emotion recognition. However, the results of empirical studies of face-emotion recognition in individuals with ASD have yielded inconsistent findings that occlude understanding the role of face-emotion recognition deficits in the development of ASD. The goal of this meta-analysis was to address three as-yet unanswered questions. Are ASDs associated with consistent face-emotion recognition deficits? Do deficits generalize across multiple emotional expressions or are they limited to specific emotions? Do age or cognitive intelligence affect the magnitude of identified deficits? The results indicate that ASDs are associated with face-emotion recognition deficits across multiple expressions and that the magnitude of these deficits increases with age and cannot be accounted for by intelligence. These findings suggest that, whereas neurodevelopmental processes and social experience produce improvements in general face-emotion recognition abilities over time during typical development, children with ASD may experience disruptions in these processes, which suggested distributed functional impairment in the neural architecture that subserves face-emotion processing, an effect with downstream developmental consequences.\n",

            "OBJECTIVE: Fluid intelligence and the behavioral problems of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are related to academic performance, but how this association occurs is unclear. This study aimed to assess mediation and moderation models that test possible pathways of influence between these factors. METHODS: Sixty-two children with ADHD and 33 age-matched, typically developing students were evaluated with Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices and the spelling and arithmetic subtests of the Brazilian School Achievement Test. Dimensional ADHD symptomatology was reported by parents. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that fluid intelligence has a significant impact on academic tests through inattention. The inattentive dimension was the principal behavioral source of influence, also accounting for the association of hyperactive-impulsive manifestations with school achievement. This cognitive-to-behavioral influence path seems to be independent of diagnosis related group, and gender, but lower socioeconomic status might increase its strength. CONCLUSION: Fluid intelligence is a relevant factor in the influence of ADHD behavioral symptoms on academic performance, but its impact is indirect. Therefore, early identification of both fluid intelligence and inattentive symptoms is of the utmost importance to prevent impaired academic performance and future difficulties in functioning.\n",

METHODS: The study included 49 gifted children aged 9-18 years and 56 age and gender-matched healthy children of normal intelligence. The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL), and the Children's Depression Rating Scale were applied to all the cases. The Quality of Life Scale for Children, the Depression Scale for Children, the Trait-State Anxiety Inventory, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire- Adolescent Form were completed by all the participants. All the parents completed the Family Evaluation Scale, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire- Parents Form and the Parents Form of the Quality of Life Scale for Children. RESULTS: Compared to children of normal intelligence, gifted children described themselves as more inattentive and lively, social functionality was reported to be low and they had a worse perception of their physical health status. Gifted boys were determined to have more depressive symptoms than gifted girls. The parents of boys of normal intelligence reported lower academic performance than the parents of giftedboys. This difference was not determined for girls between the cases and comparative groups. CONCLUSION: All the findings obtained in this study suggest that gifted children are at risk in respect of mental health. Therefore, to be able to become healthy adults in a biopsychosocial aspect, it is important for the future of gifted children that this status can be identified at an early age, that they can receive appropriate education, that support and counselling are provided for emotional needs and that parents and teachers are fully informed.\n",

            "This study examined whether working memory (WM), inattentive symptoms, and/or hyperactive/impulsive symptoms significantly contributed to academic, behavioral, and global functioning in 8-year-old children. One-hundred-sixty 8-year-old children (75.6% male), who were originally recruited as preschoolers, completed subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition, Integrated and Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-Second Edition to assess WM and academic achievement, respectively. Teachers rated children's academic and behavioral functioning using the Vanderbilt Rating Scale. Global functioning, as rated by clinicians, was assessed by the Children's Global Assessment Scale. Multiple linear regressions were completed to determine the extent to which WM (auditory-verbal and visual-spatial) and/or inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptom severity significantly contributed to academic, behavioral, and/or global functioning. Both auditory-verbal and visual-spatial WM but not ADHD symptom severity, significantly and independently contributed to measures of academic achievement (all p < 0.01). In contrast, both WM and inattention symptoms (p < 0.01), but not hyperactivity-impulsivity (p > 0.05) significantly contributed to teacher-ratings of academic functioning. Further, inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity (p < 0.04), but not WM (p > 0.10) were significantly associated with teacher-ratings of behavioral functioning and clinician-ratings of global functioning. Taken together, it appears that WM in children may be uniquely related to academic skills, but not necessarily to overall behavioral functioning.\n",

We aimed to examine the relationship between TEI and ADHD symptoms in a sample of Egyptian children. METHOD: The study included 50 children with ADHD, who were compared on the basis of their TEI and contrasted with 25 matched healthy controls. They were subjected to the Arabic version of the following scales: Connors scale 3rd edition, parent rating form, Kiddie-Schedule for affective disorders and Schizophrenia present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL), Stanford Binet intelligence scale, 4th edition and Trait Emotional Intelligence Child form (TEI) and a semistructured clinical data sheet for sociodemographic data. RESULTS: Using TEI scale, the control group was shown to have higher scores in TEI than cases, there was a high significant difference with regards to eight of nine TEI facets together with the TEI global score. Moreover, the control group significantly outperformed ADHD children with mixed and hyperactive subtypes on TEI global score in all facets except for adaptability. Meanwhile, the inattentive group performed significantly poorer than those in the control group on TEI global score, adaptability, emotional expression, self-motivation and emotion regulation facets. Trait Emotional Intelligence was negatively correlated with four of ADHD symptom groups assessed by Connors test, namely; impulsivity, cognitive, social problem, and emotional liability symptoms. However, Impulsivity was negatively correlated with all the domains of TEI except for adaptability and emotional expression. On the other hand, oppositional symptoms did not show a significant correlation with any of the TEI facets. CONCLUSIONS: Trait emotional intelligence is highly impaired in children with ADHD and emotional deficits are corner stone features of that disorder, low impulsivity facet of TEI is highly correlated with social problems and poor peer relations.\n",

This prospective birth cohort study probed the previously observed association between in utero exposure to acetaminophen and neurodevelopment by using concentrations of acetaminophen measured in meconium, which more objectively captures exposure of the fetus than maternal report. Exposure, measured by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, was categorized into nondetection, low detection, and high detection levels. At age 6-8 years, children completed a set of subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition. Additionally, this study examined potential effect modification by child sex on the association between acetaminophen exposure and neurodevelopment. In fully adjusted models, in utero exposure to acetaminophen was not statistically significantly associated with decreased scores on any of the examined subtests in all children combined (n = 118). The effect of in utero acetaminophen exposure on the Coding subtest was marginally significantly different among boys and girls, with girls performing significantly better on the task with higher levels of acetaminophen compared with girls with undetectable levels of exposure (betagirls, low = 2.83 [0.97, 4.70], betagirls, high = 1.95 [-0.03, 3.93], betaboys, low = .02 [-1.78, 1.81], betaboys, high = -.39 [-2.09, 1.31], pinteraction = .06).

            "Though stimulant drugs such as cocaine are considered highly addictive, some individuals report recreational use over long periods without developing dependence. Difficulties in response inhibition have been hypothesized to contribute to dependence, but previous studies investigating response inhibition in recreational cocaine users have reported conflicting results. Performance on a stop-signal task was examined in 24 recreational cocaine users and 32 healthy non-drug using control participants matched for age, gender and verbal intelligence during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. The two groups were further matched on traumatic childhood histories and the absence of family histories of addiction. Results revealed that recreational cocaine users did not significantly differ from controls on any index of task performance, including response execution and stop-signal reaction time, with the latter averaging 198 ms in both groups. Functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses indicated that, compared with controls, stopping in the recreational users was associated with increased activation in the pre-supplementary motor area but not the right inferior frontal cortex. Thus, findings imply intact response inhibition abilities in recreational cocaine users, though the distinct pattern of accompanying activation suggests increased recruitment of brain areas implicated in response inhibition. This increased recruitment could be attributed to compensatory mechanisms that enable preserved cognitive control in this group, possibly relating to their hypothetical resilience to stimulant drug dependence. Such overactivation, alternatively, may be attributable to prolonged cocaine use leading to neuroplastic adaptations.\n",

The groups did not differ in age or gender. Participants with Type 1 diabetes had a disease duration of 5-17.7 years. History of glycaemic control (HbA1c , diabetic ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycaemic episodes) was obtained via medical records and interviews. RESULTS: The participants with Type 1 diabetes had a lower mean estimated verbal intelligence (IQ) level compared with those in the control group (P=0.04). Greater exposure to hyperglycaemia over time was associated with lower spelling abilities within the group with Type 1 diabetes (P=0.048), even after controlling for age, gender, socio-economic status, blood glucose level at time of testing and verbal IQ (P=0.01). History of severe hypoglycaemia or ketoacidosis was not associated with differences in academic abilities.

We examined the effects of AEDs on behavioral characteristics and cognitive development among school age children born to women with epilepsy. METHODS: Children aged 6-15 years and born to women with epilepsy were enrolled in the study. Information was collected on the women's demographics and the details of their usage/non-usage of AEDs during pregnancy. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for the Children-Revised (WICS-R) test was administered to the children. The Alexander IQ test and the Conner Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) were administered to the mothers. Comparisons were made between children who had been exposed and not exposed to AEDs in utero and if exposed, according to exposure to AED monotherapy or polytherapy. The mother's education level and IQ score and data from the same parent's siblings were evaluated with respect to consanguinity. RESULTS: Forty-one children born to 28 women with epilepsy were enrolled. Seven mothers had multiple pregnancies. Twenty-three pregnancies (56%) were exposed to monotherapy and five (12.1%) to polytherapy. The remaining 13 (31.7%) were not exposed to AEDs. Maternal education level was a significant major factor in child IQ development (P < 0.05). The performance IQ-coding scale results were lower in children exposed to polytherapy than in children exposed to monotherapy in utero (P < 0.05). Although it is difficult to assert with confidence, the sibling assessment indicated a negative effect of valproate on IQ.

A less common condition among patients with TLE is intermittent explosive disorder (IED), a specific form of aggressive behavior that has been linked to low intelligence and structural pathology in the amygdala. We aimed to identify other neuroanatomical substrates of both cognitive dysfunction and IED in patients with TLE, with special focus on the cerebellum, a brain region known to participate in functional networks involved in neuropsychological and affective processes. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging-based volumetric data from 60 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (36 with and 24 without IED) were evaluated. Cerebellar, hippocampal, and total brain volumes were processed separately. In a total of 50 patients, the relationship between volumetric measurements and clinical and neuropsychological data (full-scale, verbal, and performance intelligence quotients) was analyzed. RESULTS: Intermittent explosive disorder in patients with TLE was not significantly linked to any of the regional volumes analyzed. However, cognitive performance showed a significant association both with total brain volume and cerebellar volume measurements, whereby the left cerebellar volume showed the strongest association. A deviation from normal cerebellar volumes was related to lower intelligence. Of note, left cerebellar volume was influenced by age and duration of epilepsy. Hippocampal volumes had a minor influence on cognitive parameters. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that cerebellar volume is not linked to IED in patients with TLE but is significantly associated with cognitive dysfunction. Our findings support recent hypotheses proposing that the cerebellum has a relevant functional topography.\n",

Identifying these MRI features is critical for the diagnosis and management of temporal lobe epilepsy. To date, this process relies on visual assessment by highly trained human experts (e.g. neuroradiologists, epileptologists). Artificial intelligence is increasingly recognized as a promising aid in the radiological evaluation of neurological diseases, yet its applications in temporal lobe epilepsy have been limited. Here, we applied a convolutional neural network to assess the classification accuracy of temporal lobe epilepsy based on structural MRI. We demonstrate that convoluted neural networks can achieve high accuracy in the identification of unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy cases even when the MRI had been originally interpreted as normal by experts. We show that accuracy can be potentiated by employing smoothed grey matter maps and a direct acyclic graphs approach. We further discuss the foundations for the development of computer-aided tools to assist with the diagnosis of epilepsy.\n",

            "The importance of neuropsychological examinations in epilepsy care and, especially, in epilepsy surgery is centered on the following roles: they offer a means to confirm the epileptic focus by multi-modal preoperative assessments and they help to assess postoperative functional changes based on preoperative cognitive functions. Furthermore, assessments of the cognitive functions of patients with epilepsy using various tests aid in providing comprehensive medical care. Thus far, research on cognitive functions related to temporal lobe epilepsy has focused on memory, language, and general intelligence. However, the concept of social cognitive function has been recently proposed in the field of neuropsychology. This cognitive function, proposed by Brothers in 1990, is a collective term for functions needed in social life; these include functions required to interpret the expressions, feelings, and intentions of others and to form and maintain smooth human relationships while making decisions necessary for self-survival. These functions mainly involve facial expression recognition and decision-making. Findings of research on neural mechanisms underlying social cognitive functions have emphasized the roles of the cerebral limbic system, such as the amygdalo-hippocampal complexes, and the emotional system in the ventromedial prefrontal area. Studies on social cognitive functions in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy are being pursued currently. Early-onset right mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis is the key substrate determining a severe deficit in recognizing emotional facial expressions and decision-making. In the future, neuropsychological examinations of social cognition, in addition to those of global intelligence, memory, and verbal function, will contribute to the provision of comprehensive medical care to patients with epilepsy.\n",

            "Breast cancer is widespread worldwide and can be cured if diagnosed early. Using digital mammogram images and image processing with artificial intelligence can play an essential role in breast cancer diagnosis. As many computerized algorithms for breast cancer diagnosis have significant limitations, such as noise handling and varying or low contrast in the images, it can be difficult to segment the abnormal region. These challenges could be overcome by proposing a new pre-processing model, exploring its impact on the post-processing module, and testing it on an extensive database. In this research work, the three-step method is proposed and validated on large databases of mammography images. The first step corresponded to the database classification, followed by the second step, which removed the pectoral muscle from the mammogram image. The third stage utilized new image-enhancement techniques and a new segmentation module to detect abnormal regions in a well-enhanced image to diagnose breast cancer. The pre-and post-processing modules are based on novel image processing techniques. The proposed method was tested using data collected from different hospitals in the Qassim Health Cluster, Qassim Province, Saudi Arabia. This database contained the five categories in the Breast Imaging and Reporting and Data System and consisted of 2892 images; the proposed method is analyzed using the publicly available Mammographic Image Analysis Society database, which contained 322 images. The proposed method gives good contrast enhancement with peak-signal to noise ratio improvement of 3 dB. The proposed method provides an accuracy of approximately 92% on 2892 images of Qassim Health Cluster, Qassim Province, Saudi Arabia. The proposed method gives approximately 97% on the Mammographic Image Analysis Society database. The novelty of the proposed work is that it could work on all Breast Imaging and Reporting and Data System categories. The performance of the proposed method demonstrated its ability to improve the diagnostic performance of the computerized breast cancer detection method.\n",

It is unclear, however, how much variance in intelligence other brain measurements would account for if included together with brain volume in a multivariable model. We examined a large sample of individuals in their seventies (n = 672) who were administered a comprehensive cognitive test battery. Using structural equation modelling, we related six common magnetic resonance imaging-derived brain variables that represent normal and abnormal features-brain volume, cortical thickness, white matter structure, white matter hyperintensity load, iron deposits, and microbleeds-to g and to fluid intelligence. As expected, brain volume accounted for the largest portion of variance (~ 12%, depending on modelling choices). Adding the additional variables, especially cortical thickness (+~ 5%) and white matter hyperintensity load (+~ 2%), increased the predictive value of the model. Depending on modelling choices, all neuroimaging variables together accounted for 18-21% of the variance in intelligence. These results reveal which structural brain imaging measures relate to g over and above the largest contributor, total brain volume. They raise questions regarding which other neuroimaging measures might account for even more of the variance in intelligence.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Decline in cognitive functioning precedes the first psychotic episode in the course of schizophrenia and is considered a hallmark symptom of the disorder. Given the low incidence of schizophrenia, it remains a challenge to investigate whether cognitive decline coincides with disease-related changes in brain structure, such as white matter abnormalities. The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is an appealing model in this context, as 25% of patients develop psychosis. Furthermore, we recently showed that cognitive decline also precedes the onset of psychosis in individuals with 22q11DS. Here, we investigate whether the early cognitive decline in patients with 22q11DS is associated with alterations in white matter microstructure. METHODS: We compared the fractional anisotropy (FA) of white matter in 22q11DS patients with cognitive decline [n = 16; -18.34 (15.8) VIQ percentile points over 6.80 (2.39) years] to 22q11DS patients without cognitive decline [n = 18; 17.71 (20.17) VIQ percentile points over 5.27 (2.03) years] by applying an atlas-based approach to diffusion-weighted imaging data. RESULTS: FA was significantly increased (p < 0.05, FDR) in 22q11DS patients with a cognitive decline in the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus, the bilateral cingulum bundle, all subcomponents of the left internal capsule and the left superior frontal-occipital fasciculus as compared with 22q11DS patients without cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: Within 22q11DS, the early cognitive decline is associated with microstructural differences in white matter. At the mean age of 17.8 years, these changes are reflected in increased FA in several tracts. We hypothesize that similar brain alterations associated with cognitive decline take place early in the trajectory of schizophrenia.\n",

            "PURPOSE: Cognitive decline is frequently observed after chemotherapy. As chemotherapy is associated with changes in brain white matter microstructure, we investigated whether white matter microstructure before chemotherapy is a risk factor for cognitive decline after chemotherapy. METHODS: Neuropsychologic tests were administered before and 6 months (n = 49), 2 years (n = 32), and 3 years (n = 32) after chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy (BC + CT group), at matched intervals to patients with BC who did not receive systemic therapy (BC - CT group: n = 39, 23, and 19, respectively) and to no-cancer controls (NC group: n = 37, 29, and 28, respectively). Using multivariate normative comparison, we evaluated to what extent the cognitive profiles of patients deviated from those of controls. Fractional anisotropy (FA), derived from magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, was used to measure white matter microstructure before treatment. FA was evaluated as a risk factor for cognitive decline, in addition to baseline age, fatigue, cognitive complaints, and premorbid intelligence quotient. We subsequently ran voxel-wise diffusion tensor imaging analyses to investigate white matter microstructure in specific nerve tracts. RESULTS: Low FA independently predicted cognitive decline early (6 months, P = .013) and late (3 years, P < .001) after chemotherapy. FA did not predict cognitive decline in the BC - CT and NC groups. Voxel-wise analysis indicated involvement of white matter tracts essential for cognitive functioning. CONCLUSION: Low FA may reflect low white matter reserve. This may be a risk factor for cognitive decline after chemotherapy for BC. If validated in future trials, identification of patients with low white matter reserve could improve patient care, for example, by facilitating targeted, early interventions or even by influencing choices of patients and doctors for receiving chemotherapy.\n",

            "Patients with schizophrenia can exhibit intelligence decline, which is an important element of cognitive impairment. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia have altered gray matter structures and functional connectivity associated with intelligence decline defined by a difference between premorbid and current intelligence quotients (IQs). However, it has remained unclear whether white matter microstructures are related to intelligence decline. In the present study, the indices of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) obtained from 138 patients with schizophrenia and 554 healthy controls were analyzed. The patients were classified into three subgroups based on intelligence decline: deteriorated (94 patients), preserved (42 patients), and compromised IQ (2 patients) groups. Given that the DTI of each subject was acquired using either one of two different MRI scanners, we analyzed DTI indices separately for each scanner group. In the comparison between the deteriorated IQ group and the healthy controls, differences in some DTI indices were noted in three regions of interest irrespective of the MRI scanners, whereas differences in only one region of interest were noted between the preserved IQ group and the healthy controls. However, the comparisons between the deteriorated and preserved IQ groups did not show any reproducible differences. Together with the previous findings, it is thought that gray matter structures and functional connectivity are more promising as markers of intelligence decline in schizophrenia than white matter microstructures.\n",

The structures - hippocampus (vital for learning and memory) and cerebellum (play a role in motor behavior and cognition) - which develop postnatally, are affected by developmental Pb exposure. The effect of low level of Pb exposure during specific periods of early brain development on early neurobehavioral outcomes in rat pups has not been studied. So in this study, pregnant albino Wistar strain rats were exposed to low levels of Pb in drinking water during gestation period (G group), lactation period (L group), both gestation and lactation period (GL group) and prior to pregnancy (a period of 1 month) (PG group). The rat pups born in each of these groups were assessed in preweaning neurobehavioral parameters including surface righting reflex, swimming development, negative geotaxis and ascending wire mesh test. The swimming development scores were low in the GL group of rats. The negative geotaxis score in GL and G groups were altered. The day of achievement of ascending wire mesh test was significantly delayed in GL, G and L groups of rats. To conclude, results show that (a) low level of Pb exposure during gestation and lactation period of brain development causes significant alterations in the early neurobehavioral and sensorimotor reflex development in the absence of concomitant weight loss and (b) gestation period only and lactation period only, Pb exposure causes alteration in some of the neurobehavioral outcomes.\n",

            "Previous studies have indicated that the harmful heavy metal lead (Pb) contamination in aquatic systems has caused intelligence development disorders and nervous system function abnormalities in juveniles due to the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier. Ionic liquids (ILs) are considered \"green\" organic solvents that can replace traditional organic solvents. Studies have found the presence of ILs in soil and water due to chemical applications or unintentional leakage. Therefore, what would happen if Pb interacted with ILs in a body of water? Could ILs enable Pb to more easily cross the blood-brain barrier? Therefore, we examined the combined exposure of Pb and ILs in common carp at low concentration (18.3 mg L(-1) of Pb(CH(3)COO)(2)*3 H(2)O and 11 mg L(-1) of the IL 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium chloride, 5% of their LC(50)) for 28 days in the present study. The result of a neurobehavioral assay showed that chronic exposure of lead at lower concentrations significantly altered fish movement and neurobehaviors, indicating that lead exposure caused neurotoxicity in the carp. Increases in the neurotransmitter dopamine levels and injuries in the fish brain accounted for neurobehavioral abnormalities induced by lead exposure. Moreover, we also found that lead could easily cross the blood-brain barrier and caused significant bioaccumulation in the brain. Particularly, our study indicated that the ionic liquid could not synergistically promote blood-brain barrier permeability and hence failed to increase the absorption of lead in the fish brain, suggesting that the combined exposure of lead and ILs was not a synergistic effect but antagonism to the neurotoxicity. The results of this study suggested that ILs could recede the Pb induced neurotoxicity in fish.\n",

Two adolescent cross-sectional relationships remained in the adjusted models for males only, suggesting a positive association between BLLs and increasing time for correct responses on the attentional domain task (beta = 15.08, 95% CI 0.65, 29.51) and decreasing time for correct responses on the episodic memory task (beta = -73.49, 95% CI -138.91, -8.06) in males at 12 years.

            "Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by social impairments, including inappropriate responses to affective stimuli and nonverbal cues, which may extend to poor face-emotion recognition. However, the results of empirical studies of face-emotion recognition in individuals with ASD have yielded inconsistent findings that occlude understanding the role of face-emotion recognition deficits in the development of ASD. The goal of this meta-analysis was to address three as-yet unanswered questions. Are ASDs associated with consistent face-emotion recognition deficits? Do deficits generalize across multiple emotional expressions or are they limited to specific emotions? Do age or cognitive intelligence affect the magnitude of identified deficits? The results indicate that ASDs are associated with face-emotion recognition deficits across multiple expressions and that the magnitude of these deficits increases with age and cannot be accounted for by intelligence. These findings suggest that, whereas neurodevelopmental processes and social experience produce improvements in general face-emotion recognition abilities over time during typical development, children with ASD may experience disruptions in these processes, which suggested distributed functional impairment in the neural architecture that subserves face-emotion processing, an effect with downstream developmental consequences.\n",

Few large cohort studies have examined differential impairment of cognitive function in EP-born adolescents in relation to early life risk factors, including maternal social disadvantage, gestational age at delivery, and neonatal morbidities prevalent among EP neonates. OBJECTIVES: To assess cognitive abilities in relation to early life risk factors in an EP-born cohort at 15 years of age. METHODS: 681 of 1198 surviving participants (57%) enrolled from 2002 to 2004 in the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn Study returned at age 15 years for an assessment of cognitive abilities with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-II and the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery (NTCB) verbal cognition and fluid processing composites, the latter of which measured executive functions and processing speed. Three cognitive outcomes, WASI-II IQ, NTCB verbal cognition, and NTCB fluid processing, were analyzed for associations with maternal social disadvantage and gestational age. Mediation of maternal social disadvantage by gestational age and mediation of gestational age by neonatal morbidities were also examined. RESULTS: Test scores were lower for NTCB fluid processing relative to IQ and NTCB verbal abilities. Social disadvantage and gestational age were associated with all three cognitive outcomes. Mediation analyses indicated partial mediation of gestational age associations with all three outcomes by neonatal morbidities but did not support mediation by gestational age of social risk associations with cognitive outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Greater maternal social disadvantage and lower gestational age are associated with less favorable cognitive outcomes among EP-born adolescents at 15 years of age. Neonatal morbidities partially mediate associations between lower gestational age and cognitive outcomes. These findings highlight the need for improved medical and remedial interventions to mitigate risk of poor cognitive outcomes among EP-born adolescents.\n",

Do these regions represent a collection of independent systems, or is there an overarching functional architecture spanning all of object-driven cortex? Inspired by recent work in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and cognitive science, we consider the hypothesis that these regions can be understood as a coherent network implementing an integrative computational system that unifies the functions needed to perceive, predict, reason about, and plan with physical objects-as in the paradigmatic case of using or making tools. Our proposal draws on a modeling framework that combines multiple AI methods, including causal generative models, hybrid symbolic-continuous planning algorithms, and neural recognition networks, with object-centric, physics-based representations. We review evidence relating specific components of our proposal to the specific regions that comprise object-driven cortex, and lay out future research directions with the goal of building a complete functional and mechanistic account of this system.\n",

A review of 23 German intelligence test manuals shows that test-authors do not exclude the use of their tests for children with disabilities.

There is no sufficient discussion and reflection concerning the issue which construct-irrelevant requirements may reduce the validity of the test or which individual test-adaptations are allowed or recommended. Intelligence testing of children with disabilities needs more empirical evidence on objectivity, reliability, and validity of the assessment-procedures employed.

STUDY DESIGN: The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) is a cross-sectional survey (1988-1994) that used complex multistage sampling design to produce nationally representative demographic and examination data. METHODS: A total of 4,823 children ages 6 to 16 years completed audiometric evaluation and cognitive testing during NHANES III. Hearing loss was defined as low-frequency pure-tone average (PTA) >25 dB (0.5, 1, 2 kHz) or high-frequency PTA >25 dB (3, 4, 6, 8 kHz) and was designated as unilateral or bilateral. Nonverbal intelligence was measured using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised block design subtest. Low nonverbal intelligence was defined as a standardized score <4, two standard deviations below the standardized mean of 10. RESULTS: Mean nonverbal intelligence scores differed between children with normal hearing (9.59) and children with bilateral (6.87; P = .02) but not unilateral (9.12; P = .42) hearing loss. Non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity and family income <$20,000 were associated with 3.92 and 1.67 times higher odds of low nonverbal intelligence, respectively (odds ratio [OR]: 3.92; P < .001; OR: 1.67; P = .02). Bilateral hearing loss was independently associated with 5.77 times increased odds of low nonverbal intelligence compared to normal hearing children (OR: 5.77; P = .02). Unilateral hearing loss was not associated with higher odds of low nonverbal intelligence (OR: 0.73; P = .40).

In particular we related the arithmetic achievement of children with CI to nonverbal IQ, reading skills and hearing variables. METHODS: 23 children with CI (onset of hearing loss in the first 24 months, cochlear implantation in the first 60 months of life, atleast 3 years of hearing experience with the first CI) and 23 normal hearing peers matched by age, gender, and social background participated in this case control study. All attended grades two to four in primary schools. To assess their arithmetic achievement, all children completed the \"Arithmetic Operations\" part of the \"Heidelberger Rechentest\" (HRT), a German arithmetic test. To assess reading skills and nonverbal intelligence as potential predictors of arithmetic achievement, all children completed the \"Salzburger Lesetest\" (SLS), a German reading screening, and the Culture Fair Intelligence Test (CFIT), a nonverbal intelligence test. RESULTS: Children with CI did not differ significantly from hearing children in their arithmetic achievement. Correlation and regression analyses revealed that in children with CI, arithmetic achievement was significantly (positively) related to reading skills, but not to nonverbal IQ. Reading skills and nonverbal IQ were not related to each other. In normal hearing children, arithmetic achievement was significantly (positively) related to nonverbal IQ, but not to reading skills. Reading skills and nonverbal IQ were positively correlated. Hearing variables were not related to arithmetic achievement.

            "Reelin, a large extracellular protein, plays several critical roles in brain development and function. It is encoded by RELN, first identified as the gene disrupted in the reeler mouse, a classic neurological mutant exhibiting ataxia, tremors and a 'reeling' gait. In humans, biallelic variants in RELN have been associated with a recessive lissencephaly variant with cerebellar hypoplasia, which matches well with the homozygous mouse mutant that has abnormal cortical structure, small hippocampi and severe cerebellar hypoplasia. Despite the large size of the gene, only 11 individuals with RELN-related lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia from six families have previously been reported. Heterozygous carriers in these families were briefly reported as unaffected, although putative loss-of-function variants are practically absent in the population (probability of loss of function intolerance = 1). Here we present data on seven individuals from four families with biallelic and 13 individuals from seven families with monoallelic (heterozygous) variants of RELN and frontotemporal or temporal-predominant lissencephaly variant. Some individuals with monoallelic variants have moderate frontotemporal lissencephaly, but with normal cerebellar structure and intellectual disability with severe behavioural dysfunction. However, one adult had abnormal MRI with normal intelligence and neurological profile. Thorough literature analysis supports a causal role for monoallelic RELN variants in four seemingly distinct phenotypes including frontotemporal lissencephaly, epilepsy, autism and probably schizophrenia. Notably, we observed a significantly higher proportion of loss-of-function variants in the biallelic compared to the monoallelic cohort, where the variant spectrum included missense and splice-site variants. We assessed the impact of two canonical splice-site variants observed as biallelic or monoallelic variants in individuals with moderately affected or normal cerebellum and demonstrated exon skipping causing in-frame loss of 46 or 52 amino acids in the central RELN domain. Previously reported functional studies demonstrated severe reduction in overall RELN secretion caused by heterozygous missense variants p.Cys539Arg and p.Arg3207Cys associated with lissencephaly suggesting a dominant-negative effect. We conclude that biallelic variants resulting in complete absence of RELN expression are associated with a consistent and severe phenotype that includes cerebellar hypoplasia. However, reduced expression of RELN remains sufficient to maintain nearly normal cerebellar structure. Monoallelic variants are associated with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity even within the same family and may have dominant-negative effects. Reduced RELN secretion in heterozygous individuals affects only cortical structure whereas the cerebellum remains intact. Our data expand the spectrum of RELN-related neurodevelopmental disorders ranging from lethal brain malformations to adult phenotypes with normal brain imaging.\n",

To date, six de novo SNAP25 mutations have been reported in patients with neurological features including seizures, intellectual disability, severe speech delay, and cerebellar ataxia. Here, we analyzed an Israeli family with two affected siblings showing seizures and cerebellar dysfunction by whole-exome sequencing, and identified a novel missense SNAP25 mutation (c.176G > C, p.Arg59Pro) inherited from their unaffected father. Two SNAP25 isoforms are known, SNAP25a and SNAP25b, which each contain a different exon 5. The c.176G > C mutation found in this study was specific to SNAP25b, while five previously reported mutations were identified in exons common to both isoforms. Another was previously reported to be specific to SNAP25b. Comparing clinical features of reported patients with SNAP25 mutations, the current patients demonstrated apparently milder clinical features with normal intelligence, and no magnetic resonance imaging abnormality or facial dysmorphism. Our results expand the clinical spectrum of SNAP25 mutations.\n",

This study aimed to broaden the phenotypic-spectrum of disease related with SCN8A mutations. METHODS: To identify the pathogenic gene of a Chinese family, in which six members suffered from epilepsy, whole-exome sequencing was performed. In addition, target next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on 178 sporadic patients, who had epilepsy of unknown etiology within 6 months after birth. A detailed clinical history was obtained. RESULTS: A heterozygous missense mutation of SCN8A was identified in the Chinese family. Six de novo mutations of SCN8A were detected in 6 sporadic patients with epilepsy. In the family, six members developed seizures within a few years after birth. Five of them had milder clinical performance, that they had normal cognition and developmental milestones, and seizure-free was achieved by mono-therapy. The other one affected member presented with refractory epilepsy and developmental regression. She died from sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) at 17-year-old. Clinical features of six sporadic patients with SCN8A mutations were diverse, ranging from severe epileptic encephalopathy to benign epilepsy with normal cognition. Seizures started at the mean age of 3.9 months (from 2 months to 6 months). Seizure-free was achieved in four of them by mono- or multi-antiepileptic drugs. Five of them demonstrated mild or severe psychomotor retardation, whereas the other one was normal in development and intelligence. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings extend the spectrum of SCN8A mutations and the clinical features of patients with SCN8A mutations. The majority of SCN8A mutations were de novo, inherited mutations from the heterozygous parents can also occur. The phenotypic spectrum of SCN8A mutation varied largely. Most affected patients manifested as refractory epilepsy and severe intellectual disability, only a small number of patients presented with milder clinical patterns. Additionally, our study confirmed that the same mutation can lead to different phenotypes.\n",

Based on the mode of inheritance and radiographic features, at least three types of brachyolmia have been postulated. We recently identified an autosomal recessive form of brachyolmia that is caused by loss-of-function mutations of PAPSS2, the gene encoding PAPS (3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate) synthase 2. To understand brachyolmia caused by PAPSS2 mutations (PAPSS2-brachyolmia), we extended our PAPSS2 mutation analysis to 13 patients from 10 families and identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in all. Nine different mutations were found: three splice donor-site mutations, three missense mutations, and three insertion or deletion mutations within coding regions. In vitro enzyme assays showed that the missense mutations were also loss-of-function mutations. Phenotypic characteristics of PAPSS2-brachyolmia include short-trunk short stature, normal intelligence and facies, spinal deformity, and broad proximal interphalangeal joints. Radiographic features include platyspondyly with rectangular vertebral bodies and irregular end plates, broad ilia, metaphyseal changes of the proximal femur, including short femoral neck and striation, and dysplasia of the short tubular bones. PAPSS2-brachyolmia includes phenotypes of the conventional clinical concept of brachyolmia, the Hobaek and Toledo types, and is associated with abnormal androgen metabolism.\n",

After adjusting for maternal IQ, age and Mn exposure, child IQ drops by 8.6 points for a 10-fold increase in PbB levels. Moreover, an effect modification of Mn co-exposure was observed. In children with low MnTn, association between Pb and child IQ was not significant (beta = -6.780, p = 0.172).

We study the impact of joint exposure to Mn and Pb on cognitive performance in school-aged children participating in the Communities Actively Researching Exposure Study (CARES) based in East Liverpool, Ohio. Blood Pb levels were measured for each child (geometric mean (GM) = 1.13 mug/dL, range 0.30 mug/dL - 6.64 mug/dL). Mn was measured in participant blood, hair, and toenails with GMs of 10.1 mug/L, 360 ng/g, 0.974 mug/g, respectively. Trained team members administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV) to assess intelligence quotient (IQ). The WISC-IV provides scores for Full Scale IQ, Perceptual Reasoning, Processing Speed, Working Memory, and Verbal Comprehension. Interactions between blood Pb and all Mn biomarkers were tested in linear models adjusted for child sex, household income, and serum cotinine. Separate regression models were run for each of the Mn biomarkers. The cohort was comprised of 106 children with a mean age of 8.4 years. Interactions between blood Pb and hair Mn were significant (p < 0.05) for four out of the five IQ domains. The effect of blood Pb on IQ was more pronounced at higher levels of hair and toenail Mn. No significant associations were observed when characterizing the main effect of Mn using blood. Uncovering the health impacts associated with exposure mixtures is critical to understanding the impact of real-life conditions. Our findings suggest that joint exposure to Mn and Pb may produce heightened neurocognitive impacts even at blood Pb levels below the CDC reference concentration of 5 mug/dL.\n",

Substantial parts of the variances of human intelligence and the brain volume supporting those abilities are explained by environmental factors, and during childhood, human brains have higher plasticity and also 60% of variance of intelligence that is explained by environmental factors. Here, we review the representative environmental factors known to affect human intellectual development during each developmental stage. We describe what is (and what is not) being investigated to determine how these factors affect human brain development through analyses of volumetrical and cortical structures. In conclusion, environmental factors that affect children's intellectual development lead to three patterns of brain structural change. The first is global change in the brain structure, observed more often in the earlier phase of development. The second is structural changes concentrated in the medial prefrontal and adjacent areas and medial temporal areas, which are likely to be induced by stress in many cases. The third is sporadic region-specific change, likely to be primarily caused by use-dependent plasticity of the areas that is often observed in the later phase of development. These changes may underlie the alterations in children's intellectual development that is induced by environmental factors.\n",

Evidence suggests that EI is mediated extensively by the interplay of key emotion regions including the amygdala, insula, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, among others. The insula, in particular, is important for processing interoceptive and somatic cues that are interpreted as emotional responses. We investigated the association between EI and functional brain responses within the aforementioned neurocircuitry in response to subliminal presentations of social threat. Fifty-four healthy adults completed the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) and underwent functional magnetic brain imaging while viewing subliminal presentations of faces displaying anger, using a backward masked facial affect paradigm to minimize conscious awareness of the expressed emotion. In response to masked angry faces, the total MSCEIT scores correlated negatively with a cluster of activation located within the left insula, but not with activation in any other region of interest. Considering the insula's role in the processing of interoceptive emotional cues, the results suggest that greater EI is associated with reduced emotional visceral reactivity and/or more accurate interoceptive prediction when confronted with stimuli indicative of social threat.\n",

Our study is the first to investigate the association of TEI with resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the key nodes of SCN and SMC [medial prefromtal cortex (mPFC) and bilateral anterior insula (AI), respectively] and other brain regions. We found that (a) the intrapersonal factor of TEI was negatively correlated with RSFC between mPFC and the anterior part of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), (b) the TEI interpersonal factor score was positively correlated with RSFC between mPFC and the lingual gyrus, and (c) total TEI was positively correlated with RSFC between mPFC and the precuneus as well as (d) between the left AI and the middle part of the right DLPFC. Taken together with previous study findings, our findings can be comprehensively understood as neural mechanisms of SCN and SMC components are associated with TEI. In particular, the fluent interaction between SCN's two key nodes (mPFC and precuneus/PCC) [as well as between DMN's two key nodes] is suggested to be crucial for total TEI. Our study also indicated that (a) a clear functional separation between the two key nodes of the two major intrinsic networks, DMN and the task-positive network (mPFC and DLPFC), is important for higher intrapersonal TEI, (b) brain interactions involving vision-related areas (lingual gyrus) and the key node of SCN (mPFC) are important for interpersonal TEI, and (c) control of DLPFC over the key node of SMC (AI) is important for total TEI.\n",

While amyloid-beta plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain define AD proteinopathy, it has become evident that diverse coding and non-coding regions of the genome may significantly contribute to AD neurodegeneration. The diversity of factors associated with AD pathogenesis, coupled with age-associated damage, suggests that a series of triggering events may be required to initiate AD. Since somatic mutations accumulate with aging, and aging is a major risk factor for AD, there is a great potential for somatic mutational events to drive disease. Indeed, recent data from the Gozes team/laboratories as well as other leading laboratories correlated the accumulation of somatic brain mutations with the progression of tauopathy. In this review, we lay the current perspectives on the principal genetic factors associated with AD and the potential causes, highlighting the contribution of somatic mutations to the pathogenesis of late onset Alzheimer's disease. The roles that artificial intelligence and big data can play in accelerating the progress of causal somatic mutation markers/biomarkers identification, and the associated drug discovery/repurposing, have been highlighted for future AD and other neurodegenerations, with the aim to bring hope for the vulnerable aging population.\n",

An MPS-specific physical symptom scale was developed and introduced a Physical Symptom Score (PSS) to quantify the somatic disease burden across MPS I, II and VI. HYPOTHESIS: Somatic burden of disease in patients with attenuated MPS I, II and VI as measured by the PSS will be positively associated with age and negatively associated with neuropsychological functions [i.e. full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) and attention]. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with attenuated MPS I (n = 24), II (n = 14), and VI (n = 10) aged 6 to 32 years on enzyme replacement therapy who were enrolled in \"Longitudinal Studies of Brain Structure and Functions in MPS Disorders\" across seven centers. Somatic disease burden was measured by the PSS. Neuropsychological functions were measured by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) and Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA). RESULTS: PSS was positively associated with age in attenuated MPS I (P < 0.001), MPS II (P < 0.01) and MPS VI (P < 0.05). There was a negative association of PSS with FSIQ in attenuated MPS I (P < 0.001) and in MPS VI (P < 0.001) but not with MPS II. Although attention scores were below average in all groups, a significant negative association between PSS and one measures of sustained attention (TOVA d prime) was found only in MPS VI. CONCLUSIONS: Physical Symptom Score increased with age in attenuated MPS I, II and VI, reflecting progressive somatic burden of disease despite treatment with enzyme replacement therapy. Furthermore, the association of increased somatic disease burden with decreased neurocognitive ability suggests that both measures reflect disease severity and are not independent.\n",

            "OBJECTIVES: Progress has been made in recent years in the provision of amplification and early intervention for children who are hard of hearing. However, children who use hearing aids (HAs) may have inconsistent access to their auditory environment due to limitations in speech audibility through their HAs or limited HA use. The effects of variability in children's auditory experience on parent-reported auditory skills questionnaires and on speech recognition in quiet and in noise were examined for a large group of children who were followed as part of the Outcomes of Children with Hearing Loss study. DESIGN: Parent ratings on auditory development questionnaires and children's speech recognition were assessed for 306 children who are hard of hearing. Children ranged in age from 12 months to 9 years. Three questionnaires involving parent ratings of auditory skill development and behavior were used, including the LittlEARS Auditory Questionnaire, Parents Evaluation of Oral/Aural Performance in Children rating scale, and an adaptation of the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing scale. Speech recognition in quiet was assessed using the Open- and Closed-Set Test, Early Speech Perception test, Lexical Neighborhood Test, and Phonetically Balanced Kindergarten word lists. Speech recognition in noise was assessed using the Computer-Assisted Speech Perception Assessment. Children who are hard of hearing were compared with peers with normal hearing matched for age, maternal educational level, and nonverbal intelligence. The effects of aided audibility, HA use, and language ability on parent responses to auditory development questionnaires and on children's speech recognition were also examined. RESULTS: Children who are hard of hearing had poorer performance than peers with normal hearing on parent ratings of auditory skills and had poorer speech recognition. Significant individual variability among children who are hard of hearing was observed. Children with greater aided audibility through their HAs, more hours of HA use, and better language abilities generally had higher parent ratings of auditory skills and better speech-recognition abilities in quiet and in noise than peers with less audibility, more limited HA use, or poorer language abilities. In addition to the auditory and language factors that were predictive for speech recognition in quiet, phonological working memory was also a positive predictor for word recognition abilities in noise. CONCLUSIONS: Children who are hard of hearing continue to experience delays in auditory skill development and speech-recognition abilities compared with peers with normal hearing. However, significant improvements in these domains have occurred in comparison to similar data reported before the adoption of universal newborn hearing screening and early intervention programs for children who are hard of hearing. Increasing the audibility of speech has a direct positive effect on auditory skill development and speech-recognition abilities and also may enhance these skills by improving language abilities in children who are hard of hearing. Greater number of hours of HA use also had a significant positive impact on parent ratings of auditory skills and children's speech recognition.\n",

            "OBJECTIVE: Children who are hard of hearing (CHH) experience delays in spoken language and executive function, but the mechanisms for these deficits remain unresolved. Differences in auditory experience and language skills have been examined as contributing factors to deficits in executive function, primarily with children who are deaf and children with cochlear implants. The theoretical model of cumulative auditory experience quantifies auditory dosage as how much speech is audible and how often children wear their hearing aids. CHH with higher auditory dosage have better language outcomes than peers with less auditory dosage. However, the effects of auditory experience on executive function have not been studied in CHH. The goal of this study was to examine the influences of auditory experience and language skills on the development of executive function in CHH. DESIGN: We collected measures of aided speech audibility, hearing aid use, executive function, and receptive vocabulary in 177 CHH and 86 children with typical hearing who were 5- to 10 years old and matched for socioeconomic status and nonverbal intelligence. Auditory dosage was calculated by combining each child's average hours of hearing aid use with their audibility for speech to create a variable that quantifies individual differences in auditory access. RESULTS: CHH had lower receptive vocabulary and deficits in executive function related to working memory and selective attention compared to peers with typical hearing. CHH with greater auditory dosage had higher receptive vocabulary than CHH with lower auditory dosage. Better receptive vocabulary was associated with better scores on executive function measures related to working memory and attention. Auditory dosage was also directly associated with measures of verbal working memory. CONCLUSIONS: CHH have deficits in language and some, but not all, areas of executive function related to working memory and attention. Auditory dosage was associated with language abilities and verbal working memory. Language was associated with individual differences in executive function skills related to attention and working memory. These results provide support for systems theories regarding the development of executive function in CHH. Interventions that improve auditory access and language may be effective for improving executive function related to working memory and attention in CHH.\n",

            "Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by social impairments, including inappropriate responses to affective stimuli and nonverbal cues, which may extend to poor face-emotion recognition. However, the results of empirical studies of face-emotion recognition in individuals with ASD have yielded inconsistent findings that occlude understanding the role of face-emotion recognition deficits in the development of ASD. The goal of this meta-analysis was to address three as-yet unanswered questions. Are ASDs associated with consistent face-emotion recognition deficits? Do deficits generalize across multiple emotional expressions or are they limited to specific emotions? Do age or cognitive intelligence affect the magnitude of identified deficits? The results indicate that ASDs are associated with face-emotion recognition deficits across multiple expressions and that the magnitude of these deficits increases with age and cannot be accounted for by intelligence. These findings suggest that, whereas neurodevelopmental processes and social experience produce improvements in general face-emotion recognition abilities over time during typical development, children with ASD may experience disruptions in these processes, which suggested distributed functional impairment in the neural architecture that subserves face-emotion processing, an effect with downstream developmental consequences.\n",

More specifically, it identifies various types of cognitive disorders among children with CI, comparing these children's cognitive abilities to the outcomes of CI in terms of hearing and speech performance. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional cognitive testing of children with CIs. SETTING: West Danish CI Centre, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight CI children underwent postoperative cognitive evaluation. Cognitive tests included Bayley Scales of Infant Development (Bayley-III), Snijders-Oomen Nonverbal Intelligence Test Revised (SON-R) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition (WISC-IV), depending on the age of the child. Outcome measures of hearing and speech capacity after CI consisted of Categories of Auditory Performance (CAP), Speech Intelligibility Rating (SIR) and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-4 (PPVT-4). RESULTS: Only PPVT-4 correlated significantly with cognition scores. Over time, the value of CAP and SIR seems limited by a pronounced ceiling effect. CONCLUSION: The most widely used outcome tests after CI, that is CAP and SIR, may not reflect cognitive disabilities sufficiently due to pronounced ceiling effects.

METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, we administered cognitive and academic tests (Woodcock-Johnson III Spatial Relations, General Information, Letter-Word Recognition, Calculation and Spelling tests) to young people with Type 1 diabetes (n=61) and control subjects (n=26) aged 9-22 years. The groups did not differ in age or gender. Participants with Type 1 diabetes had a disease duration of 5-17.7 years. History of glycaemic control (HbA1c , diabetic ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycaemic episodes) was obtained via medical records and interviews. RESULTS: The participants with Type 1 diabetes had a lower mean estimated verbal intelligence (IQ) level compared with those in the control group (P=0.04). Greater exposure to hyperglycaemia over time was associated with lower spelling abilities within the group with Type 1 diabetes (P=0.048), even after controlling for age, gender, socio-economic status, blood glucose level at time of testing and verbal IQ (P=0.01). History of severe hypoglycaemia or ketoacidosis was not associated with differences in academic abilities. CONCLUSIONS: In children and young people, Type 1 diabetes was associated with a lower verbal IQ. Moreover, increased exposure to hyperglycaemia was associated with lower spelling performance. These results imply that hyperglycaemia can affect cognitive function and/or learning processes that may affect academic achievement.\n",

METHODS: We used a multidatabase search platform Healthcare Database Advanced Search to search Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, EMCARE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BNI, HMIC, and AMED from inception until 1 May 2019. We included studies on type 1 diabetes of any age. The outcome measure was any aspect of cognitive function. RESULTS: The 62 studies identified were grouped as severe hypoglycaemia (SH) in childhood (⩽18 years) and adult-onset (>18 years) diabetes, nonsevere hypoglycaemia (NSH) and nocturnal hypoglycaemia (NH). SH in early childhood-onset diabetes, especially seizures and coma, was associated with poorer memory (verbal and visuospatial), as well as verbal intelligence. Among adult-onset diabetes, SH was associated with poorer cognitive performance in the older age (>55 years) group only. Early versus late exposure to SH had a significant association with cognitive dysfunction (CD). NSH and NH did not have any significant association with CD, while impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia was associated with poorer memory and cognitive-processing speeds. CONCLUSION: The effect of SH on cognitive function is age dependent. Exposure to SH in early childhood (<10 years) and older age groups (>55 years) was associated with a moderate effect on the decrease in cognitive function in type 1 diabetes [PROSPERO ID: CRD42019141321].\n",

            "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and insulin depletion. Over 40% of people with T1D manage their glucose through multiple injections of long-acting basal and short-acting bolus insulin, so-called multiple daily injections (MDI)(1,2). Errors in dosing can lead to life-threatening hypoglycaemia events (<70 mg dl(-1)) and hyperglycaemia (>180 mg dl(-1)), increasing the risk of retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Machine learning (artificial intelligence) approaches are being harnessed to incorporate decision support into many medical specialties. Here, we report an algorithm that provides weekly insulin dosage recommendations to adults with T1D using MDI therapy. We employ a unique virtual platform(3) to generate over 50,000 glucose observations to train a k-nearest neighbours(4) decision support system (KNN-DSS) to identify causes of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia and determine necessary insulin adjustments from a set of 12 potential recommendations. The KNN-DSS algorithm achieves an overall agreement with board-certified endocrinologists of 67.9% when validated on real-world human data, and delivers safe recommendations, per endocrinologist review. A comparison of inter-physician-recommended adjustments to insulin pump therapy indicates full agreement of 41.2% among endocrinologists, which is consistent with previous measures of inter-physician agreement (41-45%)(5). In silico(3,6) benchmarking using a platform accepted by the United States Food and Drug Administration for evaluation of artificial pancreas technologies indicates substantial improvement in glycaemic outcomes after 12 weeks of KNN-DSS use. Our data indicate that the KNN-DSS allows for early identification of dangerous insulin regimens and may be used to improve glycaemic outcomes and prevent life-threatening complications in people with T1D.\n",

            "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), most recognized for the hallmark hyperphagia and food preoccupations, is caused by the absence of expression of the paternally active genes in the q11-13 region of chromosome 15. Since the recognition of PWS as a genetic disorder, most research has focused primarily on the medical, genetic, and behavioral aspects of the syndrome. Extensive research has not been conducted on the cognitive, speech, and language abilities in PWS. In addition, language differences with regard to genetic mechanism of PWS have not been well investigated. To date, research indicates overall language ability is markedly below chronological age with expressive language more impaired than receptive language in people with PWS. Thus, the aim of the present study was to further characterize expressive and receptive language ability in 35 participants with PWS and compare functioning by genetic subtype using the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-4 (CELF-IV). Results indicate that core language ability is significantly impaired in PWS and both expressive and receptive abilities are significantly lower than verbal intelligence. In addition, participants with the maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD) genetic subtype exhibit discrepant language functioning with higher expressive vs. receptive language abilities. Future research is needed to further examine language functioning in larger genetic subtype participant samples using additional descriptive measures. Further work should also delineate findings with respect to size of the paternal deletion (Type 1 and Type 2 deletions) and explore how overexpression of maternally expressed genes in the 15q11-13 region may relate to verbal ability. LEARNING OUTCOMES: After reading this article, the reader will be able to: (1) summarize primary characteristics of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), (2) describe differentiating characteristics for the PWS genetic subtypes, (3) recall limited research regarding language functioning in PWS to date, (4) summarize potential genetic variations of language ability in Prader-Willi syndrome, and (5) summarize language ability in PWS with respect to adaptive functioning.\n",

The topic has a long history in the social sciences and has been the topic of a large number of studies, many reporting a negative gradient between intelligence and fertility. We link fertility histories to military conscription tests with intelligence scores for all Swedish men born 1951-1967. We find a positive relationship between intelligence scores and fertility, and this pattern is consistent across the cohorts we study. The relationship is most pronounced for the transition to a first child, and men with the lowest categories of IQ scores have the fewest children. Using fixed effects models, we additionally control for all factors that are shared by siblings, and after such adjustments, we find a stronger positive relationship between IQ and fertility. Furthermore, we find a positive gradient within groups at different levels of education. Compositional differences of this kind are therefore not responsible for the positive gradient we observe-instead, the relationship is even stronger after controlling for both educational careers and parental background factors. In our models where we compare brothers to one another, we find that, relative to men with IQ 100, the group with the lowest category of cognitive ability have 0.56 fewer children, and men with the highest category have 0.09 more children.\n",

However, some studies of people born around 1950, particularly from Sweden, have reported that higher intelligence is associated with lower consumption and fewer alcohol-related problems. We investigated the relationships between intelligence, alcohol consumption, and adverse consequences of drinking in young men from Norway (a neighboring Scandinavian country) born in the late 1970s. METHODS: This analysis was based on the population-based Young in Norway Longitudinal Study. Our sample included young men who had been followed from their mid-teens until their late 20s (n = 1126). Measures included self-reported alcohol consumption/intoxication, alcohol use disorders (AUDIT), and a scale measuring adverse consequences of drinking. Controls included family background, parental bonding, and parents' and peers' drinking. Intelligence test scores-scaled in 9 \"stanines\" (population mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2)-were taken from conscription assessment. RESULTS: Men with higher intelligence scores reported average drinking frequency and slightly fewer adverse consequences in their early 20s. In their late 20s, they reported more frequent drinking than men with lower intelligence scores (0.30 more occasions per week, per stanine, age adjusted; 95% CI: 0.12 to 0. 49). Intelligence was not associated with intoxication frequency at any age and did not moderate the relationships between drinking frequency and adverse consequences. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the relationship between intelligence and drinking frequency is age dependent.

            "OBJECTIVE: The possible contributions of psychosocial functioning and intelligence differences to socioeconomic status (SES)-related inequalities in premature death were investigated. None of the previous studies focusing on inequalities in mortality has included measures of both psychosocial functioning and intelligence. METHODS: The study was based on a cohort of 49 321 men born 1949-1951 from the general community in Sweden. Data on psychosocial functioning and intelligence from military conscription at  approximately 18 years of age were linked with register data on education, occupational class, and income at 35-39 years of age. Psychosocial functioning was rated by psychologists as a summary measure of differences in level of activity, power of initiative, independence, and emotional stability. Intelligence was measured through a multidimensional test. Causes of death between 40 and 57 years of age were followed in registers. RESULTS: The estimated inequalities in all-cause mortality by education and occupational class were attenuated with 32% (95% confidence interval: 20-45%) and 41% (29-52%) after adjustments for individual psychological differences; both psychosocial functioning and intelligence contributed to account for the inequalities. The inequalities in cardiovascular and injury mortality were attenuated by as much as 51% (24-76%) and 52% (35-68%) after the same adjustments, and the inequalities in alcohol-related mortality were attenuated by up to 33% (8-59%). Less of the inequalities were accounted for when those were measured by level of income, with which intelligence had a weaker correlation. The small SES-related inequalities in cancer mortality were not attenuated by adjustment for intelligence. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in psychosocial functioning and intelligence might both contribute to the explanation of observed SES-related inequalities in premature death, but the magnitude of their contributions likely varies with measure of socioeconomic status and cause of death. Both psychosocial functioning and intelligence should be considered in future studies.\n",

            "Objectives To examine the association between intelligence measured in childhood and leading causes of death in men and women over the life course.Design Prospective cohort study based on a whole population of participants born in Scotland in 1936 and linked to mortality data across 68 years of follow-up.Setting Scotland.Participants 33 536 men and 32 229 women who were participants in the Scottish Mental Survey of 1947 (SMS1947) and who could be linked to cause of death data up to December 2015.Main outcome measures Cause specific mortality, including from coronary heart disease, stroke, specific cancer types, respiratory disease, digestive disease, external causes, and dementia.Results Childhood intelligence was inversely associated with all major causes of death. The age and sex adjusted hazard ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) per 1 SD (about 15 points) advantage in intelligence test score were strongest for respiratory disease (0.72, 0.70 to 0.74), coronary heart disease (0.75, 0.73 to 0.77), and stroke (0.76, 0.73 to 0.79). Other notable associations (all P<0.001) were observed for deaths from injury (0.81, 0.75 to 0.86), smoking related cancers (0.82, 0.80 to 0.84), digestive disease (0.82, 0.79 to 0.86), and dementia (0.84, 0.78 to 0.90). Weak associations were apparent for suicide (0.87, 0.74 to 1.02) and deaths from cancer not related to smoking (0.96, 0.93 to 1.00), and their confidence intervals included unity. There was a suggestion that childhood intelligence was somewhat more strongly related to coronary heart disease, smoking related cancers, respiratory disease, and dementia in women than men (P value for interactions <0.001, 0.02, <0.001, and 0.02, respectively).Childhood intelligence was related to selected cancer presentations, including lung (0.75, 0.72 to 0.77), stomach (0.77, 0.69 to 0.85), bladder (0.81, 0.71 to 0.91), oesophageal (0.85, 0.78 to 0.94), liver (0.85, 0.74 to 0.97), colorectal (0.89, 0.83 to 0.95), and haematopoietic (0.91, 0.83 to 0.98). Sensitivity analyses on a representative subsample of the cohort observed only small attenuation of the estimated effect of intelligence (by 10-26%) after adjustment for potential confounders, including three indicators of childhood socioeconomic status. In a replication sample from Scotland, in a similar birth year cohort and follow-up period, smoking and adult socioeconomic status partially attenuated (by 16-58%) the association of intelligence with outcome rates.Conclusions In a whole national population year of birth cohort followed over the life course from age 11 to age 79, higher scores on a well validated childhood intelligence test were associated with lower risk of mortality ascribed to coronary heart disease and stroke, cancers related to smoking (particularly lung and stomach), respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, injury, and dementia.\n",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the brain activity of individuals with AN while performing a task requiring cognitive flexibility on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), which is one of the most frequently used neurocognitive measures of cognitive flexibility and problem-solving ability. METHODS: Participants were 15 female AN patients and 15 age- and intelligence quotient-matched healthy control women. Participants completed the WCST while their brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging during the task. Brain activation in response to set shifting error feedback and the correlation between such brain activity and set shifting performance were analyzed. RESULTS: The correct rate on the WCST was significantly poorer for AN patients than for controls. Patients showed poorer activity in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral parahippocampal cortex on set shifting than controls. Controls showed a positive correlation between correct rate and ventrolateral prefrontal activity in response to set shifting whereas patients did not. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest dysfunction of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and parahippocampal cortex as a cause of impaired cognitive flexibility in AN patients.\n",

            "In clinical settings, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with comorbid depression is often difficult to diagnose, and should be considered in treatment. However, to our knowledge, no functional imaging study has examined the difference between ASD adolescents with and without comorbid depression. We aimed to compare the characteristics and prefrontal brain function of ASD with and without depression in order to identify a biological marker that can be used to detect the difference. Twenty-eight drug-naive adolescents with ASD (14 ASD with and 14 ASD without depression) and 14 age- and gender-matched adolescents with typical development were evaluated using several variables. These included intelligence quotient, autism quotient, depression severity using the Beck Depression Inventory 2nd edition (BDI-II), and level of social functioning using the Social Adaptation Self-evaluation Scale (SASS). In addition, frontotemporal hemodynamic responses during a verbal fluency task (VFT) were measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The ASD group, including both of the ASD with and ASD without depression groups, showed smaller hemodynamic responses than the typical development group in portions of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and anterior part of the temporal cortex (aTC) during the VFT. Moreover, the smaller hemodynamic responses in the right VLPFC during the VFT in the ASD group were associated with the worse BDI-II and SASS scores. Furthermore, the ASD with depression group showed smaller hemodynamic responses in the right VLPFC during the VFT than the ASD without depression group in a direct comparison. Adolescents with ASD showed reduced activation in broad frontotemporal regions during a cognitive task compared with those with typical development. More specifically, the right VLPFC activation reflected the level of self-estimated depression and social functioning in the ASD subjects, and could be used to discriminate between ASD adolescents with and without depression.\n",

Specifically, would patients with the disorder show increased amygdala activity during social reference learning, and further, following social reference learning, show particularly increased response to objects associated with other people's negative reactions? METHOD: A total of 32 unmedicated patients with social anxiety disorder and 22 age-, intelligence quotient- and gender-matched healthy individuals responded to objects that had become associated with others' fearful, angry, happy or neutral reactions.

            "Difficulty in anger control and anger-related aggressive outbursts against others are frequently reported by patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Although male sex is a known predictor for aggression, hardly any study has addressed the neural correlates of deficient anger control in male patients with BPD. Building on previous reports in female BPD, we investigated the involvement of lateral antero- and dorsal prefrontal cortex in the control of fast emotional actions and its relation to self-reported tendencies to act out anger. 15 medication-free male patients with BPD and 25 age- and intelligence-matched healthy men took part in a social Approach-Avoidance task in the MR-scanner. This task allows the measurement of neural correlates underlying the control of fast behavioral tendencies to approach happy and avoid angry faces. Hypothesis-driven region-of-interest and exploratory whole brain analyses were used to test for activations of antero- and dorsolateral prefrontal regions and their relation with the amygdala during emotional action control as well as their association with self-reported anger out in male patients with BPD and healthy volunteers. Male patients with BPD showed reduced anterolateral prefrontal activations during emotional action control compared to healthy volunteers. Furthermore, anger out was negatively related to antero- and dorsolateral prefrontal activations, while it was positively related to amygdala activity in male patients with BPD. The current results suggest the involvement of antero- and dorsolateral prefrontal regions in controlling and overriding fast emotional actions. Deficits in lateral prefrontal emotion control seem to be a common neural mechanism underlying anger-related aggression.

            "Mercury (Hg) is neurotoxic, and children may be particularly susceptible to this effect. A current major challenge is the identification of children who may be uniquely susceptible to Hg toxicity because of genetic disposition. We examined the hypothesis that genetic variants of metallothionein (MT) that are reported to affect Hg toxicokinetics in adults would modify the neurotoxic effects of Hg in children. Five hundred seven children, 8-12 years of age at baseline, participated in a clinical trial to evaluate the neurobehavioral effects of Hg from dental amalgam tooth fillings. Subjects were evaluated at baseline and at 7 subsequent annual intervals for neurobehavioral performance and urinary Hg levels. Following the completion of the clinical trial, we performed genotyping assays for variants of MT isoforms MT1M (rs2270837) and MT2A (rs10636) on biological samples provided by 330 of the trial participants. Regression modeling strategies were employed to evaluate associations between allelic status, Hg exposure, and neurobehavioral test outcomes. Among girls, few significant interactions or independent main effects for Hg exposure and either of the MT gene variants were observed. In contrast, among boys, numerous significant interaction effects between variants of MT1M and MT2A, alone and combined, with Hg exposure were observed spanning multiple domains of neurobehavioral function. All dose-response associations between Hg exposure and test performance were restricted to boys and were in the direction of impaired performance. These findings suggest increased susceptibility to the adverse neurobehavioral effects of Hg among children with relatively common genetic variants of MT, and may have important public health implications for future strategies aimed at protecting children and adolescents from the potential health risks associated with Hg exposure. We note that because urinary Hg reflects a composite exposure index that cannot be attributed to a specific source, these findings do not support an association between Hg in dental amalgams specifically and the adverse neurobehavioral outcomes observed.\n",

Ninety-three children born or living in the study area participated in the study. A neurobehavioral test battery consisting of 12 tests assessing various functions of the nervous system was applied as well as a questionnaire regarding events of exposure of children's mothers to contaminants during perinatal period. Hair samples were taken from children to determine manganese concentrations. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied in order to examine possible relationships between exposure events, hair manganese, and neurobehavioral disorders. Having controlled co-variables such as age and educational level, it was found that children with elevated levels of hair manganese (over 2 mug/g) had poor performance in the test of general intelligence (Raven's Progressive Color Matrices Scale PCM). The Ecohealth approach helped to identify that children in the lower Puyango Basin with very elevated levels of manganese in the river water (970 microg/L) are the ones who have the highest levels of hair manganese and the worst performance in the intelligence test.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), was found to be associated with poorer neurological development in children. Knowledge about the effects on outcomes until adolescence is limited. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether prenatal exposure to POPs, particularly hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs), is associated with cognitive and motor development in 13- to 15-year-old children. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study is part of the Development at Adolescence and Chemical Exposure (DACE)-study, a follow-up of two Dutch birth cohorts. Maternal pregnancy serum levels of PCB-153 and three OH-PCBs were measured, in part of the cohort also nine other PCBs and three OH-PCBs, and in another part five polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), dichloroethene (DDE), pentachlorophenol (PCP) and hexabroomcyclododecane (HBCDD). Of the 188 invited adolescents, 101 (53.7%) participated, 55 were boys. Cognition (intelligence, attention, verbal memory) and motor performance (fine motor, ball skills, balance) were assessed. Scores were classified into 'normal' (IQ > 85; scores > P15) and '(sub)clinical' (IQ </= 85; scores </= P15). We used linear and logistic regression analyses, and adjusted for maternal education, maternal smoking, maternal alcohol use, breast feeding, and age at examination. RESULTS: Several OH-PCBs were associated with more optimal sustained attention and balance. PCB-183 was associated with lower total intelligence (OR: 1.29; 95%CI:0.99-1.68; P = .060), and HBCDD with lower performance intelligence (OR: 3.62; 95%CI:0.97-13.49; P = .056). PCBs, OH-PCBs and PBDEs were negatively associated with verbal memory. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal background exposure to several POPs can influence neuropsychological outcomes in 13- to 15-year-old Dutch adolescents, although exposure to most compounds does not have clinically relevant consequences at adolescence.\n",

Lesser known is the relationship with neurobehavioral domains, especially in adolescence. This study sought to identify cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between lead exposure and adolescent executive and visual-motor functioning and examine sex-based differences. Participants were 681 children from Jintan, China who had their blood lead levels (BLLs) assessed at age 3-5 years and 12 years old and neurobehavioral functioning assessed through the University of Pennsylvania Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (PennCNB) platform http://www.med.upenn.edu/bbl at 12 years old. Mean BLLs were 6.41 mcg/dl at age 3-5 years and 3.10 mcg/dl at 12. BLLs at 3-5 years and 12 years were used as predictors for the individual neurobehavioral domains in general linear models while controlling for father and mother occupation and education, residence location, age, and adolescent IQ. Models were run separately for males and females. In adjusted models, males BLLs at 3-5 years were associated with increased time to correctly complete tasks in multiple domains including abstraction/flexibility (beta = 19.90, 95% CI( 4.26, 35.54) and spatial processing (beta = 96.00, 95% CI 6.18, 185.82) at 12 years. For females in adjusted models, BLLs at 3-5 years were associated with increasing time to correctly complete tasks on the episodic memory domain task (beta = 34.59, 95% CI 5.33, 63.84) at 12 years. Two adolescent cross-sectional relationships remained in the adjusted models for males only, suggesting a positive association between BLLs and increasing time for correct responses on the attentional domain task (beta = 15.08, 95% CI 0.65, 29.51) and decreasing time for correct responses on the episodic memory task (beta = -73.49, 95% CI -138.91, -8.06) in males at 12 years.

Many reports have suggested that ginsenosides could exert prominent neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects, promote neural stem/progenitor cell (NSC) proliferation and promote neurite outgrowth and neuronal network formation. The present study aimed to investigate whether treatment with ginsenosides could facilitate NSC proliferation in the hippocampal formation after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and contribute to the recovery of neurological functions including learning and memory. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The modified Feeney׳s method was used to induce a TBI in rats. Ginseng total saponins (GTS) were treated intraperitoneally twice a day for 1 week after the TBI. The neurological functions, morphology of the hippocampus, expression of nerve growth-related factors and number of NSCs in the hippocampal formation ipsilateral to the trauma were determined. RESULTS: We determined 1) GTS (5-80 mg/kg) treatment after a TBI improved the recovery of neurological functions, including learning and memory, and reduced cell loss in the hippocampal area. The effects of GTS at 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg/kg were better than the effects of GTS at 5 and 10 mg/kg. 2) GTS treatment (20 mg/kg) after a TBI increased the expression of NGF, GDNF and NCAM, inhibited the expression of Nogo-A, Nogo-B, TN-C, and increased the number of BrdU/nestin positive NSCs in the hippocampal formation. CONCLUSIONS: GTS treatment in rats after a TBI alleviated the secondary brain injury and ameliorated the neurological functions with an effective dose limit of 5-80 mg/kg. GTS regulated the expression of nerve growth-related factors and improved the proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells, which might facilitate neural regeneration and tissue repair, and might contribute to the recovery of neurological functions, including learning and memory. These effects of GTS might provide a foundation for the use of ginseng as a medicinal herb to enhance intelligence, reduce the aging process and prolong life in the traditional medicine.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: There are many types of neurological diseases with complex etiologies. At present, most clinical drugs can only relieve symptoms but cannot cure these diseases. Radix Polygalae, a famous traditional Chinese medicine from the root of plants of the genus Polygala, has the traditional effect of treating insomnia, forgetfulness, and palpitation and improving intelligence and other symptoms of neurological diseases. Saponins are important bioactive components of plants of the genus Polygala and exhibit neuroprotective effects. PURPOSE: This review aimed to summarize the traditional use of Polygala species and discuss the latest phytochemical, pharmacological, and toxicological findings, mainly with regard to Polygala saponins in the treatment of neurological disorders. METHODS: Literature was searched and collected using databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, CNKI, and Google Scholar. The search terms used included \"Polygala\", \"saponins\", \"neurological diseases\", \"Alzheimer's disease\", \"toxicity\", etc., and combinations of these keywords. A total of 1202 papers were retrieved until August 2022, and we included 135 of these papers on traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and other fields. RESULTS: This literature review mainly reports on the traditional use of the Polygala genus and prescriptions containing Radix Polygalae in neurological diseases. Phytochemical studies have shown that plants of the genus Polygala mainly include saponins, flavonoids, oligosaccharide esters, alkaloids, coumarins, lignans, flavonoids, etc. Among them, saponins are the majority. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that Polygala saponins have neuroprotective effects on a variety of neurological diseases. Its mechanism of action involves autophagic degradation of misfolded proteins, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, antioxidative stress and so on. Toxicological studies have shown that Polygala saponins trigger gastrointestinal toxicity, and honey processing and glycosyl disruption of Polygala saponins can effectively ameliorate its gastrointestinal side effect. CONCLUSION: Polygala saponins are the major bioactive components in plants of the genus Polygala that exhibit therapeutic potential in various neurological diseases. This review provides directions for the future study of Polygala saponins and references for the clinical use of prescriptions containing Radix Polygalae for the treatment of neurological diseases.\n",

We aimed to determine the association between headache and other common symptoms after pediatric traumatic brain injury and explore whether subjective complaints of headache are associated with objective deficits on specialized neurocognitive testing. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children ages 3-19 years following traumatic brain injury with a completed Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) questionnaire. Post-traumatic headache was defined by a score more than 2 on the SCAT question for headache and define headache groups for comparison. In our cohort, we analyzed data from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Second Edition (WASI-II). Headache was reported in 40 (33%) patients presenting for post-traumatic brain injury care among 121 pediatric traumatic brain injury patients and did not differ by injury severity. Median total SCAT symptom score in the headache group was 5-fold higher compared to patients without headache (median 45.5 vs 9; P < .001). Significantly lower-scaled scores in color naming, matrix reasoning, letter sequencing, and letter switching were also found in the headache group (all P </= .03). Our study shows that headache, as reported by patients on the SCAT, is associated with higher symptom scores in all other symptom domains, including sleep, mood, sensory, and cognitive. Headache was also associated with worse objective neurocognitive measures and may identify patients who could benefit from specialized follow-up care and management.\n",

            "Mismatch negativity is generated automatically, and is an early monitoring indicator of neuronal integrity impairment and functional abnormality in patients with brain injury, leading to decline of cognitive function. Antipsychotic medication cannot affect mismatch negativity. The present study aimed to explore the relationships of mismatch negativity with neurocognition, daily life and social functional outcomes in patients after brain injury. Twelve patients with traumatic brain injury and 12 healthy controls were recruited in this study. We examined neurocognition with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised China, and daily and social functional outcomes with the Activity of Daily Living Scale and Social Disability Screening Schedule, respectively. Mismatch negativity was analyzed from electroencephalogram recording. The results showed that mismatch negativity amplitudes decreased in patients with traumatic brain injury compared with healthy controls. Mismatch negativity amplitude was negatively correlated with measurements of neurocognition and positively correlated with functional outcomes in patients after traumatic brain injury. Further, the most significant positive correlations were found between mismatch negativity in the fronto-central region and measures of functional outcomes. The most significant positive correlations were also found between mismatch negativity at the FCz electrode and daily living function. Mismatch negativity amplitudes were extremely positively associated with Social Disability Screening Schedule scores at the Fz electrode in brain injury patients. These experimental findings suggest that mismatch negativity might efficiently reflect functional outcomes in patients after traumatic brain injury.\n",

However, the results of empirical studies of face-emotion recognition in individuals with ASD have yielded inconsistent findings that occlude understanding the role of face-emotion recognition deficits in the development of ASD. The goal of this meta-analysis was to address three as-yet unanswered questions. Are ASDs associated with consistent face-emotion recognition deficits? Do deficits generalize across multiple emotional expressions or are they limited to specific emotions? Do age or cognitive intelligence affect the magnitude of identified deficits? The results indicate that ASDs are associated with face-emotion recognition deficits across multiple expressions and that the magnitude of these deficits increases with age and cannot be accounted for by intelligence. These findings suggest that, whereas neurodevelopmental processes and social experience produce improvements in general face-emotion recognition abilities over time during typical development, children with ASD may experience disruptions in these processes, which suggested distributed functional impairment in the neural architecture that subserves face-emotion processing, an effect with downstream developmental consequences.\n",

The aim of this study was to explore the association between hypertensive disorders and other maternal biological and social factors on the risk of mild cognitive limitations (intelligence quotient 50-85) in the offspring. METHODS: An 11.5-year follow-up study of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (n = 9432) was utilised. The analysis included 8847 singleton children, of whom 198 had mild cognitive limitations. Gestational hypertension was defined as de novo hypertension (blood pressure >/= 140/90), diagnosed mid-pregnancy in a previously normotensive woman. Data on intelligence level of the children were based on standardised intelligence test results. RESULTS: Eleven per cent (n = 20) of mothers having a child with mild cognitive limitations had gestational hypertension. Maternal gestational hypertension was independently associated with increased odds of mild cognitive limitation in the offspring (odds ratio 2.4 [95% confidence interval 1.4, 3.9]). Other independent maternal risk factors for mild cognitive limitation were high pre-pregnancy body mass index (>/=30 kg/m(2)), multiparity (>/=4) and low education. In addition family's socio-economic status lower than professional, male gender and small birthweight-for-gestational age appeared as independent risk factors for mild cognitive limitation. CONCLUSIONS: Gestational hypertension should be considered as one of the adverse early risk factors that may predispose to impaired cognitive development in childhood.\n",

It is well established that maternal macronutrient intake during pregnancy influences foetal and infant development. Therefore, we hypothesise that macronutrient intakes during pregnancy are correlated with cognitive development during early childhood. The current study aimed to investigate the relationship between maternal macronutrient intake during pregnancy and child cognitive and behavioural outcomes at age 4 years. We analysed prospective data from a cohort of 64 Australian mother-child dyads. Maternal macronutrient intake was assessed using a validated 74-item food frequency questionnaire at 2 timepoints during pregnancy. Child cognition and behaviour were measured at age 4 years using the validated Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, 3rd version (WPPSI-III) and the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBC). Linear regression models were used to quantify statistical relationships and were adjusted for maternal age, education, pre-pregnancy BMI, breastfeeding duration and birthweight. Child Performance IQ was inversely associated with maternal starch intake (b = -11.02, p = 0.03). However, no other associations were found.

The objective of this study is to find the relationship of ERPs with learning and memory recall and predict the memory recall score using P300 (P3) component. METHOD: A sample of thirty-four healthy subjects between twenty and thirty years of age was selected to perform three tasks: (1) Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM) test to assess fluid intelligence; (2) learning and memory task to assess learning ability and memory recall; and (3) the visual oddball task to assess brain-evoked potentials. These subjects were divided into High Ability (HA) and Low Ability (LA) groups based on their RAPM scores. A multiple regression analysis was used to predict the learning & memory recall and fluid intelligence using P3 amplitude and latency. RESULTS: Behavioral results demonstrated that the HA group learned and recalled 10.89 % more information than did the LA group. ERP results clearly showed that the P3 amplitude of the HA group was relatively larger than that observed in the LA group for both the central and parietal regions of the cerebrum; particularly during the 300-400 ms time window. In addition, a shorter latency for the P3 component was observed at Pz site for the HA group compared to the LA group. These findings agree with previous educational psychology and neuroimaging studies which reported an association between ERPs and fluid intelligence as well as learning performance. CONCLUSION: These results also suggest that the P3 component is associated with individual differences in learning and memory recall and further indicate that P3 amplitude might be used as a supporting factor in standard psychometric tests to assess an individual's learning & memory recall ability; particularly in educational institutions to aid in the predictability of academic skills.\n",

            "There has been some controversy as to whether baseline pupil size is related to individual differences in cognitive ability. Previously, we had shown that a larger baseline pupil size was associated with higher cognitive ability and that the correlation to fluid intelligence was larger than that to working memory capacity (Tsukahara, Harrison, & Engle, 2016). However, other researchers have not been able to replicate our findings - though they only measured working memory capacity and not fluid intelligence. Many of the studies showing no relationship had major methodological issues, namely small baseline pupil size values - down to the physiological minimum - that resulted in reduced variability on baseline pupil size. We conducted two large-scale studies to investigate how different lighting conditions affect baseline pupil size values and the correlation with cognitive abilities. We found that fluid intelligence, working memory capacity, and attention control did correlate with baseline pupil size except in the brightest lighting conditions. We showed that a reduced variability in baseline pupil size values is due to the monitor settings being too bright. Overall, our findings demonstrated that the baseline pupil size - working memory capacity relationship was not as strong or robust as that with fluid intelligence or attention control. Our findings have strong methodological implications for researchers investigating individual differences in task-free or task-evoked pupil size. We conclude that fluid intelligence does correlate with baseline pupil size and that this is related to the functional organization of the resting-state brain through the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system.\n",

            "The sleep spindle, a waxing and waning oscillation in the sigma frequency range, has been shown to correlate with fluid intelligence; i.e. the ability to use logic, learn novel rules/patterns, and solve problems. Using simultaneous EEG and fMRI, we previously identified the neural correlates of this relationship, including activation of the thalamus, bilateral putamen, medial frontal gyrus, middle cingulate cortex, and precuneus. However, research to date has focussed primarily on non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and spindles per se, thus overlooking the possibility that brain activity that occurs in other sleep-wake states might also be related to cognitive abilities. In our current study, we sought to investigate whether brain activity across sleep/wake states is also related to human intelligence in N = 29 participants. During NREM sleep, positive correlations were observed between fluid intelligence and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activations in the bilateral putamen and the paracentral lobule/precuneus, as well as between short-term memory (STM) abilities and activity in the medial frontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. During wake, activity in bilateral postcentral gyri and occipital lobe was positively correlated with short-term memory abilities. In participants who experienced REM sleep in the scanner, fluid intelligence was positively associated with midbrain activation, and verbal intelligence was associated with right postcentral gyrus activation. These findings provide evidence that the relationship between sleep and intellectual abilities exists beyond sleep spindles.\n",

            "OBJECTIVES: The overall goal of this study was to compare verbal and visuospatial working memory in children with normal hearing (NH) and with cochlear implants (CI). The main questions addressed by this study were (1) Does auditory deprivation result in global or domain-specific deficits in working memory in children with CIs compared with their NH age mates? (2) Does the potential for verbal recoding affect performance on measures of reasoning ability in children with CIs relative to their NH age mates? and (3) Is performance on verbal and visuospatial working memory tasks related to spoken receptive language level achieved by children with CIs? DESIGN: A total of 54 children ranging in age from 5 to 9 years participated; 25 children with CIs and 29 children with NH. Participants were tested on both simple and complex measures of verbal and visuospatial working memory. Vocabulary was assessed with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) and reasoning abilities with two subtests of the WISC-IV (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition): Picture Concepts (verbally mediated) and Matrix Reasoning (visuospatial task). Groups were compared on all measures using analysis of variance after controlling for age and maternal education. RESULTS: Children with CIs scored significantly lower than children with NH on measures of working memory, after accounting for age and maternal education. Differences between the groups were more apparent for verbal working memory compared with visuospatial working memory. For reasoning and vocabulary, the CI group scored significantly lower than the NH group for PPVT and WISC Picture Concepts but similar to NH age mates on WISC Matrix Reasoning. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest that children with CIs have deficits in working memory related to storing and processing verbal information in working memory. These deficits extend to receptive vocabulary and verbal reasoning and remain even after controlling for the higher maternal education level of the NH group. Their ability to store and process visuospatial information in working memory and complete reasoning tasks that minimize verbal labeling of stimuli more closely approaches performance of NH age mates.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Childhood maltreatment is considered an important risk factor for the development of major depression. Research indicates an association between childhood adversity and altered emotion processing. Depression is characterized by mood-congruent cognitive biases, which play a crucial role in symptom persistence and recurrence. However, whether attentional biases in adult major depression are associated with experienced childhood neglect or abuse remains unclear. METHODS: A sample of 45 patients suffering from major depression were recruited to examine correlations between maltreatment experienced during childhood and attentional biases to sad and happy facial expressions. Attention allocation was assessed using the dot-probe task and a history of childhood maltreatment was measured by means of the 25-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). RESULTS: Our results indicate an association between childhood maltreatment and sustained attention toward sad facial expressions. This relationship was not confounded by severity of symptoms, age, verbal intelligence or more recent stressful experiences.

            "IMPORTANCE AND OBJECTIVES: Childhood adversity is a strong risk factor for the development of various psychopathologies including major depressive disorder (MDD). However, not all depressed patients experience early life trauma. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using facial emotion processing tasks have documented altered blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses in specific cortico-limbic networks both in MDD patients and in individuals with a history of childhood maltreatment (CM). Therefore, a history of maltreatment may represent a key modulating factor responsible for the altered processing of socio-affective stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we recruited MDD patients with and without of maltreatment history to study the long-term consequences of childhood trauma and examined the impact of CM on brain activity using a facial emotion recognition fMRI task. METHODS: MDD patients with childhood maltreatment (MDD + CM, n = 21), MDD patients without maltreatment (MDD, n = 19), and healthy controls (n = 21) matched for age, sex and intelligence quotient underwent fMRI while performing a block design facial emotion matching task with images portraying negative emotions (fear, anger and sadness). The history of maltreatment was assessed with the 28-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. RESULTS: Both MDD and MDD + CM patients displayed impaired accuracy to recognize sad faces. Analysis of brain activity revealed that MDD + CM patients had significantly reduced negative BOLD signals in their right accumbens, subcallosal cortex, and anterior paracingulate gyrus compared to controls. Furthermore, MDD + CM patients had a significantly increased negative BOLD response in their right precentral and postcentral gyri compared to controls. We found little difference between MDD and MDD + CM patients, except that MDD + CM patients had reduced negative BOLD response in their anterior paracingulate gyrus relative to the MDD group. CONCLUSIONS: Our present data provide evidence that depressed patients with a history of maltreatment are impaired in facial emotion recognition and that they display altered functioning of key reward-related fronto-striatal circuits during a facial emotion matching task.\n",

            "BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Evidence suggests that childhood maltreatment (ie, childhood abuse and childhood neglect) affects educational attainment and cognition. However, the association between childhood maltreatment and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) seems stronger among controls compared to people with psychosis. We hypothesised that: the association between childhood maltreatment and poor cognition would be stronger among community controls than among people with first-episode of psychosis (FEP); compared to abuse, neglect would show stronger associations with educational attainment and cognition; the association between childhood maltreatment and IQ would be partially accounted for by other risk factors; and the association between childhood maltreatment, educational attainment, and IQ would be stronger among patients with affective psychoses compared to those with nonaffective psychoses. STUDY DESIGN: 829 patients with FEP and 1283 community controls from 16 EU-GEI sites were assessed for child maltreatment, education attainment, and IQ. STUDY RESULTS: In both the FEP and control group, childhood maltreatment was associated with lower educational attainment. The association between childhood maltreatment and lower IQ was robust to adjustment for confounders only among controls. Whereas childhood neglect was consistently associated with lower attainment and IQ in both groups, childhood abuse was associated with IQ only in controls. Among both patients with affective and nonaffective psychoses, negative associations between childhood maltreatment and educational attainment were observed, but the crude association with IQ was only evident in affective psychoses. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the role of childhood maltreatment in shaping academic outcomes and cognition of people with FEP as well as controls.\n",

The objectives of the present meta-analysis were to (1) investigate the impact of maltreatment on neuropsychological functioning of people with psychiatric disorders and to (2) evaluate the moderating effect of age, at the time of the cognitive assessment, on neuropsychological functioning. METHODS: Seventeen studies published between 1970 and July 2017 were included. RESULTS: The results showed a negative impact of maltreatment with a small effect size (g = -0.25) on the neuropsychological performances in the group with psychiatric disorders with a history of exposure to childhood maltreatment compared to the group with psychiatric disorders without a history of exposure to childhood maltreatment. Cognitive domains that are significantly affected by maltreatment are: working memory (g = -0.56), verbal episodic memory (g = -0.39), intelligence (g = -0.27) and processing speed (g = -0.21). The impact of childhood maltreatment on the cognitive profile is greater in adults than young people. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should consider these common cognitive deficits using a transdiagnostic approach in cognitive interventions.\n",

            "With the development of information technology, the concept of smart healthcare has gradually come to the fore. Smart healthcare uses a new generation of information technologies, such as the Internet of Things (loT), big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, to transform the traditional medical system in an all-around way, making healthcare more efficient, more convenient, and more personalized. miRNAs can regulate the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of human cells. Relevant studies have also shown that miRNAs may play a key role in the occurrence and development of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI). This study aims to explore the effects of miR-489 in MIRI. In this study, miR-489 expression in a myocardial ischemia-reperfusion animal model and H9C2 cells induced by H/R was detected by qRT-PCR. The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the activity of creatine kinase (CK) was detected after miR-489 knockdown in H9C2 cells induced by H/R. The apoptosis of H9C2 cells and animal models were determined by ELISA. The relationship between miR-489 and SPIN1 was verified by a double fluorescence reporter enzyme assay. The expression of the PI3K/AKT pathway-related proteins was detected by Western blot. Experimental results showed that miR-489 was highly expressed in cardiac muscle cells of the animal model and in H9C2 cells induced by H/R of the myocardial infarction group, which was positively associated with the apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells with ischemia-reperfusion. miR-489 knockdown can reduce the apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells caused by ischemia-reperfusion. In downstream targeting studies, it was found that miR-489 promotes the apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells after ischemia-reperfusion by targeting the inhibition of the SPIN1-mediated PI3K/AKT pathway. In conclusion, high expression of miR-489 is associated with increased apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells after ischemia-reperfusion, which can promote the apoptosis after ischemia-reperfusion by targeting the inhibition of the SPIN1-mediated PI3K/AKT pathway. Therefore, miR-489 can be one of the potential therapeutic targets for reducing the apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells after ischemia-reperfusion.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Improved therapeutics aimed at ameliorating the devastating effects of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), are pertinent to help attenuate their growing prevalence worldwide. One promising avenue for such therapeutics lies in botanical medicines that have been efficaciously employed in the likes of traditional medicine doctrines for millennium. Integral to this approach is the necessity of neuritogenesis and/or neuroprotection to counterbalance the deleterious effects of amyloid-beta (Abeta) proteins. Senegenin, a principle saponin of Polygala tenuifolia Willd., which has empirically shown to improve cognition and intelligence, was chosen to evaluate its cytoprotective potential and possible neuritogenic and neuroprotective effects. METHODS: The purpose of the present study was then to analyze morphological changes in neurite development and altered protein expression of two proteins requisite to neuritogenesis, growth associated protein 43 (Gap-43) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) in PC 12 cells. Neuritogenic analysis was conducted with immunofluorescence after incubation with Abeta (25-35) peptide, and to deduce information on cell viability and mitochondrial functionality MTT (3,(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was employed. RESULTS: This study found that cells pre-incubated with senegenin for 24 h (40 mug and 20 mug/ml) before introducing Abeta attenuated Abeta-cytotoxicity, and significantly increased cell viability by 23 % and 34 % (P < 0.001), respectively. In neurite outgrowth experiments, Abeta was compared to NGF positive control and senegenin treated groups which showed a drastic decrease in the quantity, average length and maximum length of neurites (P < 0.001). At concentrations of 1 mug/ml (P < 0.01) and 5 mug/ml (P < 0.05) senegenin triggered neuritogenesis with significant increases in total neurite number, average length and maximum length. This was additionally shown through the augmented expression of MAP2 and Gap-43. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that senegenin possesses cytoprotective properties, can moderate neurite outgrowth and augment MAP2 and Gap-43, thus suggesting a potential therapeutic value for Polygala tenuifolia in neurodegenerative disorders.\n",

Np-deficient mice display complex cognitive deficits and reduced levels of Plasma Membrane Ca(2+) ATPases (PMCAs), an essential regulator of the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([iCa(2+)]) and neuronal activity. We show abundant expression and conserved cellular and molecular features of Np in glutamatergic neurons in human hippocampal-cortical pathways as characterized for the rodent brain. In Nptn (lox/loxEmx1Cre) mice, glutamatergic neuron-selective Np ablation resulted in behavioral deficits indicating hippocampal, striatal, and sensorimotor dysfunction paralleled by highly altered activities in hippocampal CA1 area, sensorimotor cortex layers I-III/IV, and the striatal sensorimotor domain detected by single-photon emission computed tomography. Altered hippocampal and cortical activities correlated with reduction of distinct PMCA paralogs in Nptn (lox/loxEmx1Cre) mice and increased [iCa(2+)] in cultured mutant neurons. Human and rodent Np enhanced the post-transcriptional expression of and co-localized with PMCA paralogs in the plasma membrane of transfected cells.

            "BACKGROUND: No prospective cohort study of high-risk children has used rigorous exposure assessment and optimal diagnostic procedures to examine the perinatal antecedents of autism spectrum disorder separately among those with and without cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify perinatal factors associated with increased risk for autism spectrum disorder with and without intellectual disability (intelligence quotient <70) in children born extremely preterm. STUDY DESIGN: This prospective multicenter (14 institutions in 5 states) birth cohort study included children born at 23-27 weeks' gestation in 2002 through 2004 who were evaluated for autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability at age 10 years. Pregnancy information was obtained from medical records and by structured maternal interview. Cervical-vaginal \"infection\" refers to maternal report of bacterial infection (n = 4), bacterial vaginosis (n = 30), yeast infection (n = 62), mixed infection (n = 4), or other/unspecified infection (n = 43; eg, chlamydia, trichomonas, or herpes). We do not know the extent to which infection per se was confirmed by microbial colonization. We use the terms \"fetal growth restriction\" and \"small for gestational age\" interchangeably in light of the ongoing challenge to discern pathologically from constitutionally small newborns. Severe fetal growth restriction was defined as a birthweight Z-score for gestational age at delivery <-2 (ie, >/=2 SD below the median birthweight in a referent sample that excluded pregnancies delivered for preeclampsia or fetal indications). Participants were classified into 4 groups based on whether or not they met rigorous diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability (autism spectrum disorder+/intellectual disability-, autism spectrum disorder+/intellectual disability+, autism spectrum disorder-/intellectual disability+, and autism spectrum disorder-/intellectual disability-). Temporally ordered multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine the information conveyed by perinatal factors about increased risk for autism spectrum disorder and/or intellectual disability (autism spectrum disorder+/intellectual disability-, autism spectrum disorder+/intellectual disability+, and autism spectrum disorder-/intellectual disability+). RESULTS: In all, 889 of 966 (92%) children recruited were assessed at age 10 years, of whom 857 (96%) were assessed for autism spectrum disorder; of these, 840 (98%) children were assessed for intellectual disability. Autism spectrum disorder+/intellectual disability- was diagnosed in 3.2% (27/840), autism spectrum disorder+/intellectual disability+ in 3.8% (32/840), and autism spectrum disorder-/intellectual disability+ in 8.5% (71/840). Maternal report of presumed cervical-vaginal infection during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder+/intellectual disability+ (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-6.4). The lowest gestational age category (23-24 weeks) was associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder+/intellectual disability+ (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.6) and autism spectrum disorder+/intellectual disability- (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-11). Severe fetal growth restriction was strongly associated with increased risk for autism spectrum disorder+/intellectual disability- (odds ratio, 9.9; 95% confidence interval, 3.3-30), whereas peripartum maternal fever was uniquely associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder-/intellectual disability+ (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-6.7). CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that low gestational age is associated with increased risk for autism spectrum disorder irrespective of intellectual ability, whereas severe fetal growth restriction is strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability. Maternal report of cervical-vaginal infection is associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability, and peripartum maternal fever is associated with increased risk for intellectual disability without autism spectrum disorder.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Infants born very preterm are at higher risk of long-term neurodevelopmental problems than children born at term. Although there are increasing numbers of reports on outcomes from international cohorts of premature infants, a Swiss national report on infants after 2 years of age is lacking. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To describe neurodevelopmental outcomes at early school age of preterm children born in Switzerland with a special focus on the cognitive abilities. METHODS: This prospective national cohort study included children born alive before 30 weeks of gestation in 2006. At 5 years of age, children underwent a neurological examination and intelligence testing with the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children first edition (K-ABC). We assessed the mental processing composite score (MPC) and its subscales to explore specific cognitive deficits. The primary outcome was cognitive impairment (MPC score &lt;-1 standard deviation from the normative mean), motor impairment (cerebral palsy), or sensory impairment (any visual or hearing deficiency). The need for early intervention or therapies and the association of perinatal factors with cognitive impairment were secondary and tertiary outcomes. Logistic regression models were used to analyse associations between neonatal factors and cognitive outcome. RESULTS: Of 289 survivors, 235 were assessed. Of the 199 children with results obtained from the K-ABC, 42 (21%) showed cognitive impairment and 80 (40%) showed impairment in short-term memory. Cerebral palsy was diagnosed in 14 (6%), and visual and auditory impairment in 36 (15%) and 12 (5%) children, respectively; 63 (27%) needed early intervention or therapies. Cognitive impairment was associated with low socioeconomic status, but not with gestational age, small birthweight for gestational age, bronchodysplasia, or significant brain injury. A total of 146 children (63%) survived without any impairment. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report neurodevelopmental outcomes at early school age in a Swiss cohort. The majority had favourable outcomes, but 21% of children demonstrated cognitive impairment, which was most pronounced in short-term memory. Our findings were similar to those of international cohorts and indicate that preterm children born before 300/7 gestational weeks, especially those living in unfavourable social environments, are at an increased risk of cognitive impairment and need close monitoring beyond early school age.

RESULTS: Very low birthweight children with a mean birthweight of 1105 g (+/- 291 g) and a gestational age of 28.8 (+/- 2.2) weeks scored significantly lower in all reading subtests and cognition and demonstrated more behavioural problems than normal birthweight controls. We also found significant associations between poor vocabulary, combined with attention problems, and phonological awareness, rapid naming and spelling control. Perinatal factors had no association with reading function, and socio-economic factors had very few. CONCLUSION: Very low birthweight children demonstrated deficits in all reading domains and had poorer cognition and more behavioural problems at the age of seven, with reading ability related to vocabulary and attention.\n",

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Level III neonatal intensive care unit. PATIENTS: ELBW survivors born in 1990-2004 with available spirometry at 8 years old were studied. Children were excluded if they had a Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Third Edition full IQ <70. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify perinatal determinants associated with airway obstruction (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio <80%) at school age and the predictive power of potential determinants. Potential risk factors and predictors assessed in this study were gestational age, birth weight, small for gestational age, sex, chorioamnionitis, premature rupture of membranes, antenatal steroids, surfactant administration, respiratory distress syndrome, postnatal steroids, severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and bubbly/cystic appearances of the lungs by X-ray during the neonatal period. RESULTS: Of 656 ELBW survivors, 301 (45.9%) had attended a school-age follow-up at 8 years old. A total of 201 eligible children completed the lung function test. Bubbly/cystic appearance of the lungs (OR 4.84, 95% CI 1.26 to 18.70) was associated with a low FEV1/FVC ratio. Children with bubbly/cystic appearance had characteristics of immaturity and intrauterine inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Within a cohort of ELBW infants, a bubbly/cystic appearance of the lungs in the neonatal period was the strongest determinant of a low FEV1/FVC ratio at school age.\n",

METHODS: Participants included 120 adults with SCA with no history of neurologic dysfunction and 33 healthy controls (HCs). Participants were enrolled at 12 medical center sites, and raters were blinded to diagnostic group. We hypothesized that individuals with SCA would exhibit reductions in frontal lobe cortex thickness and reduced basal ganglia and thalamus volumes compared with HCs and that these structural brain abnormalities would be associated with measures of cognitive functioning (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd edition). RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex, education level, and intracranial volume, participants with SCA exhibited thinner frontal lobe cortex (t = -2.99, p = 0.003) and reduced basal ganglia and thalamus volumes compared with HCs (t = -3.95, p < 0.001). Reduced volume of the basal ganglia and thalamus was significantly associated with lower Performance IQ (model estimate = 3.75, p = 0.004) as well as lower Perceptual Organization (model estimate = 1.44, p = 0.007) and Working Memory scores (model estimate = 1.37, p = 0.015).

STUDY DESIGN: One hundred twelve preterm infants (born mean gestational age 28.6 +/- 1.7 weeks) were studied prospectively with magnetic resonance imaging (imaged at mean 41.6 +/- 1.0 weeks). T2- and T1-weighted images were automatically segmented, and volumes of 6 tissue types were related to neurodevelopmental outcome assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (cognitive, fine, and gross motor scores) at 24 months corrected age (n = 112), Griffiths Mental Development Scales (developmental quotient) at age 3.5 years (n = 98), Movement Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition (n = 85), and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Third Edition at age 5.5 years (n = 44). Corrections were made for intracranial volume, maternal education, and severe brain lesions. RESULTS: Ventricular volumes were negatively related to neurodevelopmental outcome at age 24 months and 3.5 years, as well as processing speed at age 5.5 years. Unmyelinated white matter (UWM) volume was positively associated with motor outcome at 24 months and with processing speed at age 5.5 years. Cortical gray matter (CGM) volume demonstrated a negative association with motor performance and cognition at 24 months and with developmental quotient at age 3.5 years. Cerebellar volume was positively related to cognition at these time points. Adjustment for brain lesions attenuated the relations between cerebellar and CGM volumes and cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Brain volumes of ventricles, UWM, CGM, and cerebellum may serve as biomarkers for neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants. The relationship between larger CGM volumes and adverse neurodevelopment may reflect disturbances in neuronal and/or axonal migration at the UWM-CGM boundary and warrants further investigation.\n",

The aim of the current study is to investigate the role of serum cortisol levels in the relationship between regional brain volumes and cognitive processing speed in a group of cognitively normal elderly subjects. Forty-one healthy elderly participants were from a parallel longitudinal study. The reported data in this study reflects baseline measurements. Whole-brain anatomical scanning was performed using a 3.0 Tesla Philips Medical Systems Achieva scanner. Cognitive processing speed was assessed by the digit-symbol and symbol search tests, from the Chinese version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-third edition (WAIS-III). Serum cortisol levels (sampled in the late morning) were measured by ELISA kits. Whole-brain regression analysis revealed that serum cortisol levels positively predicted the white matter volumes (WMV) of the right thalamus, the gray matter volumes (GMV) of the left thalamus and right cerebellar tonsil, and negatively predicted the WMV and GMV of the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) in 41 healthy elderly participants. Furthermore, serum cortisol significantly moderated the relationship between the GMV of the left MTG and processing speed, as well as the GMV of the left thalamus and processing speed. This study provided the first piece of evidence supporting serum cortisol levels in moderating the relationship between regional brain volumes and processing speed in healthy elderly subjects.

Aim of this study is to investigate whether insula volume is associated with Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and emotional processing in schizophrenia patients versus healthy controls (HC). METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans, IQ and emotional processing tests (Benton Facial Recognition Test [BFRT], Degraded Facial Affect Recognition Task [DFAR], Emotional Mentalizing Task [EMT]) were administered in 246 subjects (133 schizophrenia patients and 113 controls). First order linear regression analyses were performed with group as independent variable and IQ/emotional processing test scores as dependent variables. Second order stepwise linear regression analyses were performed with IQ/emotional processing test scores as independent variables (as well as intracranial volumes, age, gender and cannabis abuse) and right/left insula volumes as dependent ones. A final mediation analysis (Sobel test) was performed to verify if IQ or emotional processing test scores could explain the eventual differences in insula volumes between the two groups. RESULTS: Schizophrenia patients presented lower insula volumes (left: F = 9.72, p < 0.01; right: F = 10.93, p < 0.01) as compared with healthy controls. Smaller insula volumes in schizophrenia patients are mediated by lower IQ scores (Sobel tests: 3.07, p < 0.01 for right insula; 2.72, p < 0.01 for left insula), but not by impairments in emotion processing.

            "BACKGROUND: As the art of neurosurgery evolves in the 21st century, more emphasis is placed on minimally invasive techniques, which require technical precision. Simultaneously, the reduction on training hours continues, and teachers of neurosurgery faces \"double jeopardy\"-with harder skills to teach and less time to teach them. Mixed reality appears as the neurosurgical educators' natural ally: Virtual reality facilitates the learning of spatial relationships and permits rehearsal of skills, while augmented reality can make procedures safer and more efficient. Little wonder then, that the body of literature on mixed reality in neurosurgery has grown exponentially. METHODS: Publications involving virtual and augmented reality in neurosurgery were examined. A total of 414 papers were included, and they were categorized according to study design and analyzed. RESULTS: Half of the papers were published within the last 3 years alone. Whereas in the earlier half, most of the publications involved experiments in virtual reality simulation and the efficacy of skills acquisition, many of the more recent publication are proof-of-concept studies. This attests to the evolution of mixed reality in neurosurgery. As the technology advances, neurosurgeons are finding more applications, both in training and clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: With parallel advancement in Internet speed and artificial intelligence, the utilization of mixed reality will permeate neurosurgery. From solving staff problems in global neurosurgery, to mitigating the deleterious effect of duty-hour reductions, to improving individual operations, mixed reality will have a positive effect in many aspects of neurosurgery.\n",

The internal reliability of the new tasks and questionnaires was analyzed, as well as their relationship with the spatial and working memory tests. The results showed that the new spatial tasks are reliable, correlate with working memory and spatial ability tests and, compared with the latters, show stronger correlations with the self-report questionnaires referring to orientation abilities.

We investigated allocentric spatial recall using a virtual environment in a group of patients with severe hippocampal damage (SHD), a group of patients with \"moderate\" hippocampal damage (MHD), and a normal control group. Through four learning blocks with feedback, participants learned the target locations of four different objects in a circular arena. Distal cues were present throughout the experiment to provide orientation. A circular boundary as well as an intra-arena landmark provided spatial reference frames. During a subsequent test phase, recall of all four objects was tested with only the boundary or the landmark being present. Patients with SHD were impaired in both phases of this task. Across groups, performance on both types of spatial recall was highly correlated with memory quotient (MQ), but not with intelligence quotient (IQ), age, or sex. However, both measures of spatial recall separated experimental groups beyond what would be expected based on MQ, a widely used measure of general memory function. Boundary-based and landmark-based spatial recall were both strongly related to bilateral hippocampal volumes, but not to volumes of the thalamus, putamen, pallidum, nucleus accumbens, or caudate nucleus. The results show that boundary-based and landmark-based allocentric spatial recall are similarly impaired in patients with SHD, that both types of recall are impaired beyond that predicted by MQ, and that recall deficits are best explained by a reduction in bilateral hippocampal volumes. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In humans, bilateral hippocampal atrophy can lead to profound impairments in episodic memory. Across species, perhaps the most well-established contribution of the hippocampus to memory is not to episodic memory generally but to allocentric spatial memory. However, the extent to which navigational spatial memory depends on hippocampal integrity in humans is not well documented. We investigated spatial recall using a virtual environment in two groups of patients with hippocampal damage (moderate/severe) and a normal control group. The results showed that patients with severe hippocampal damage are impaired in learning and recalling allocentric spatial information. Furthermore, hippocampal volume reduction impaired allocentric navigation beyond what can be predicted by memory quotient as a widely used measure of general memory function.\n",

            "Epilepsy patients often have cognitive dysfunction even at early stages of disease. We investigated the relationship between structural findings and neuropsychological status in drug-naive newly diagnosed pediatric epilepsy patients. Thirty newly diagnosed pediatric epilepsy patients and 25 healthy control subjects aged 7~16 years were enrolled, who were assessed by the Korean version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (K-WISC-III), the Stroop test, and the trail making test (TMT). Optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed for both Gray Matter (GM) and White Matter (WM) volumes. Lower performance levels of verbal intelligence quotient, freedom from distractibility, and executive function were observed in epilepsy group. Interestingly, poor performance in these cognitive subdomains was correlated with regional VBM findings involving both GM and WM volumes, but with different patterns between groups. GM volumes revealed clear differences predominantly in the bilateral frontal regions. These findings indicate that certain cognitive functions may be affected in the early stage of epilepsy, not related to the long-standing epilepsy or medication, but more related to the neurocognitive developmental process in this age.

The aim of this study was to delineate global changes in cortical thickness and white matter integrity in patients with DM1, compared to age-matched healthy controls, and in brain areas highly correlated with CTG repeat size. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cortical thickness and white matter integrity were compared in nine adult DM1 patients and age matched healthy controls using T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging. The patients' intelligence quotient (IQ) and CTG repeat size were measured in each individual. RESULTS: Cortical thickness was significantly reduced in the frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices, while tract-based spatial statistics showed decreased diffusion metrics in widespread areas, including the bilateral orbitofrontal, anterior frontal, insular, external capsule, and occipital cortices in DM1 patients, compared to controls. Additionally, thickness was negatively correlated with the number of CTG repeats in those areas. White matter integrity was negatively correlated with CTG repeats in the left entorhinal, anterior corona radiata, orbitofrontal, and lateral occipital areas. No statistically significant correlation was found between IQ scores and the size of CTG repeats. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that DM1 is associated with wide distributions of network changes in both gray and white matter. Some of areas related to cognition showed significant correlations with CTG repeats.\n",

STUDY QUESTIONS: (1) Is the reported severity of anxiety in this group similar to that in the general older population; (2) Are specific anxiety symptoms reported as frequently by both groups? DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Formal Dutch intellectual disability services and Dutch population-based study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty-four participants of the Healthy Ageing and Intellectual Disability study with mild or moderate ID (IQ <70), aged 55-85 years, and 2,917 participants of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam with normal intelligence, aged 55-85 years. MEASUREMENTS: The general anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Mean (standard deviation) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score of subjects with ID was significantly higher than that of subjects with normal intelligence (3.53 [3.03]) versus 2.53 [3.30]; p <0.01), whereas the percentage of scores above cutoff in both groups was similar. Four of 7 items were more often reported as present by subjects with ID: \"tense or wound up feelings,\" \"frightened feelings,\" \"worrying thoughts,\" and \"sudden feelings of panic.\" CONCLUSIONS: Older people with ID report more symptoms of anxiety than older people with normal intelligence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed an Excel-based model according to International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) good practices to assess U.S. payer budget impact associated with the use of the KidneyIntelX test to optimize therapy T2DKD patients compared to standard of care (SOC) (without KidneyIntelX). A hypothetical cohort of 100,000 stages 1-3b T2DKD patients was followed for 5 years. Peer-reviewed publications were used to identify model parameter estimates. KidneyIntelX costs incremental to SOC (without KidneyIntelX) included test cost, additional prescription medication use, specialist referrals and PCP office visits. Patients managed with KidneyIntelX experienced a 20% slowed progression rate compared to SOC (without KidneyIntelX) attributed to slowed DKD progression, delayed or prevented dialysis and transplants, and reduced dialysis crashes. Associated costs were compared to SOC (without KidneyIntelX). Sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying the definition of progression and the DKD progression rate associated with KidneyIntelX testing and related interventions. RESULTS: Projected undiscounted base case 5-year savings for 100,000 patients tested with KidneyIntelX were $1.052 billion, attributed mostly to slowed progression through DKD stages. The breakeven point for the health plan adopting KidneyIntelX is expected to occur prior to year 2 after adoption. Sensitivity analysis based on the assessment of the most conservative definition of progression and a 5% reduction in progression rate attributed to KidneyIntelX, resulted in a projected 5-year savings of $145 million associated with KidneyIntelX. LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Limitations included reliance on literature-based parameter estimates, including effect size of delayed progression supported by the literature. Incorporating KidneyIntelX in contemporary care of early-stage T2DKD patients is projected to result in substantial savings to payers.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: The GluN2B subunit of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors is crucially involved in the physiology of the prefrontal cortex during working memory (WM). Consistently, genetic variants in the GluN2B coding gene (GRIN2B) have been associated with cognitive phenotypes. However, it is unclear how GRIN2B genetic variation affects gene expression and prefrontal cognitive processing. Using a composite score, we tested the combined effect of GRIN2B variants on prefrontal activity during WM performance in healthy subjects. METHOD: We computed a composite score to combine the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms on post-mortem prefrontal GRIN2B mRNA expression. We then computed the composite score in independent samples of healthy participants in a peripheral blood expression study (n = 46), in a WM behavioural study (n = 116) and in a WM functional magnetic resonance imaging study (n = 122). RESULTS: Five polymorphisms were associated with GRIN2B expression: rs2160517, rs219931, rs11055792, rs17833967 and rs12814951 (all corrected p < 0.05). The score computed to account for their combined effect reliably indexed gene expression. GRIN2B composite score correlated negatively with intelligence quotient, WM behavioural efficiency and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity. Moreover, there was a non-linear association between GRIN2B genetic score and prefrontal activity, i.e. both high and low putative genetic score levels were associated with high blood oxygen level-dependent signals in the prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple genetic variants in GRIN2B are jointly associated with gene expression, prefrontal function and behaviour during WM. These results support the role of GRIN2B genetic variants in WM prefrontal activity in human adults.\n",

            "A common source of variance (i.e., \"general intelligence\") underlies an individual's performance across diverse tests of cognitive ability, and evidence indicates that the processing efficacy of working memory may serve as one such source of common variance. One component of working memory, selective attention, has been reported to co-vary with general intelligence, and dopamine D1 signaling in prefrontal cortex can modulate attentional abilities. Based on their aggregate performance across five diverse tests of learning, here we characterized the general cognitive ability (GCA) of CD-1 outbred mice. In response to a D1 agonist (SKF82958, 1 mg/kg), we then assessed the relationship between GCA and activation of D1 receptor (D1R)-containing neurons in the prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex, the agranular insular cortex, and the dorsomedial striatum. Increased activation of D1R-containing neurons in the prelimbic cortex (but not the agranular insular cortex or dorsomedial striatum) was observed in animals of high GCA relative to those of low GCA (quantified by c-Fos activation in response to the D1 agonist). However, a Western blot analysis revealed no differences in the density of D1Rs in the prelimbic cortex between animals of high and low GCA. Last, it was observed that working memory training promoted an increase in animals' GCA and enhanced D1R-mediated neuronal activation in the prelimbic cortex. These results suggest that the sensitivity (but not density) of D1Rs in the prelimbic cortex may both regulate GCA and be a target for working memory training.\n",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the brain activity of individuals with AN while performing a task requiring cognitive flexibility on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), which is one of the most frequently used neurocognitive measures of cognitive flexibility and problem-solving ability. METHODS: Participants were 15 female AN patients and 15 age- and intelligence quotient-matched healthy control women. Participants completed the WCST while their brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging during the task. Brain activation in response to set shifting error feedback and the correlation between such brain activity and set shifting performance were analyzed. RESULTS: The correct rate on the WCST was significantly poorer for AN patients than for controls. Patients showed poorer activity in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral parahippocampal cortex on set shifting than controls. Controls showed a positive correlation between correct rate and ventrolateral prefrontal activity in response to set shifting whereas patients did not.

We recruited 151 patients with schizophrenia and 194 healthy control subjects. Psychopathology was evaluated using Operational Criteria for Psychotic Illness checklist, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Scales for Assessment of Positive and Negative Symptoms. Cognitive performance in schizophrenia patients was assessed using following tests: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Trail Making Test, Verbal Fluency Tests, Stroop and subscales from Wechsler Adults Intelligence Scale-R-Pl (Similarities, Digit Symbol Coding, Digit Span Forward and Backward). Serum IL-6 and hsCRP levels were significantly higher in schizophrenia patients in comparison with healthy controls. Both hsCRP and IL-6 levels were associated with insidious psychosis onset, duration of illness and chronic schizophrenia course with deterioration. After adjustment for age, education level, number of years of completed education, illness duration, total PANSS score, depression severity and chlorpromazine equivalent, there was still a positive association between IL-6 and hsCRP levels and worse cognitive performance. The IL6 -174G/C polymorphism did not influence IL-6 level, but it was associated with the severity of positive symptoms. Our results suggest that elevated IL-6 levels may play the role in cognitive impairment and serve as potential inflammatory biomarker of deterioration in schizophrenia.\n",

We investigated the relationships between the characteristics of EI among nurse managers, and their perceptions of how much their position's roles and responsibilities can be delegated to other staff members. METHODS: We surveyed 150 nurse managers working at 30 hospitals by using an anonymous questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of basic attributes, EI and work perception. The emotional intelligence scale (EQS) domain scores were analyzed by means of one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. EQS scores were compared with corresponding averages for working adults in the instructions. The perceived importance of duties of nurse managers was compared between the resulting EQS scores 'High' and 'Low' groups. RESULTS: The analysis population consisted of 105 nurse managers. Their EQS scored higher in all three domains, and with the exception of Altruism for all factor scores than the average for working adults. The perceived importance of the typical duties of nurse managers were compared between the High and Low groups for each EQS domain. Significant differences were observed between nurse managers with High and Low Intrapersonal emotional quotient (EQ) on four tasks. No significant differences were found for any of the responsibilities when nurse managers with High and Low Interpersonal EQ or Situational EQ were compared. CONCLUSION: The nurse managers' average EQS scores were higher in all areas. The high scores that were exhibited by could be considered desirable qualities for nurse managers. It seemed nurse managers with high scores in intrapersonal EQ struck a good balance between placing importance on EI considerations like managing relationships and creating a comfortable workplace, and management and leadership behaviors like department management and operations and data management.\n",

            "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The association between patterns of physical/mental activity and dementia and how it is affected by disease susceptibility remains unknown. We aimed to examine the association between patterns of physical and mental activity and dementia and whether it can be modified by disease susceptibility to dementia. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study based on UK Biobank, 501,376 dementia-free participants were recruited in 2006-2010 and followed from 1 year after the recruitment date until the end of 2019 for ascertainment of dementia. Data on physical (i.e., physical activity at leisure time, housework-related activity, and transportation) and mental (i.e., intelligence, social contact, and use of electronic device) activity were collected using questionnaires at recruitment. Cox models were used to estimate the associations of physical and mental activity-related items, as well as major activity patterns identified by principal component analysis, with the risk of dementia, adjusted for multiple confounders. The modification role of disease susceptibility on such associations was assessed through stratified analyses by the polygenic risk score (PRS) of dementia generated based on summary statistics of independent genome-wide association studies, by the APOE genotype, and by the self-reported family history of dementia. RESULTS: The mean age at recruitment was 56.53, and 45.60% of the participants were male. During a mean follow-up of 10.66 years, 5,185 dementia cases were identified. When analyzed separately, multiple studied items related to physical and mental activity showed significant associations with the risk of dementia. The pattern analyses revealed that a higher level of adherence to activity patterns related to frequent vigorous and other exercises (hazard ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.59-0.71), housework-related activity (0.79, 0.72-0.85), and friend/family visit (0.85, 0.75-0.96) was associated with a lower risk of dementia. We obtained comparable results for vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease as well as in the stratified analyses by the PRS for dementia, APOE genotype, or family history of dementia. DISCUSSION: Activity patterns more adherent to frequent vigorous and other exercises, housework-related activity, and friend/family visit were associated with a reduced risk of multiple types of dementia. Such associations are independent of disease susceptibility, highlighting the potential of these physical and mental activity patterns, as effective interventions, in the primary prevention of dementia.\n",

METHOD: Cognitively normal participants (mean age 57.6 years) from the Gipuzkoa Alzheimer Project study were classified as having high risk (HR; n = 82) or low risk (LR; n = 293) for dementia according to a CAIDE score cutoff of 9. Cognitive composites were compared between groups. We explored using generalized linear models the role of APOE genotype, MRI white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and CSF (n = 218) levels of beta-amyloid(1-42) (Abeta(1-42)), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in the association between CAIDE score and cognition. RESULTS: HR participants obtained lower scores on executive function (EF) (p = 0.001) and visual perception and construction (VPC) (p < 0.001) composites. EF composite was associated with CAIDE score x p-tau (p = 0.001), CAIDE score x t-tau (p = 0.001), and WMH (p = 0.003). VPC composite was associated with APOE (p = 0.001), Abeta(1-42) (p = 0.004), the interaction APOE x Abeta(1-42) (p = 0.003), and WMH (p = 0.004). Performance on global memory was associated with Abeta(1-42) (p = 0.006), APOE (p = 0.008), and their interaction (p = 0.006).

Most participants in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 completed a reasoning-type intelligence test at age 11 years, and detailed cognitive/physical assessments and structural diffusion tensor brain magnetic resonance imaging at a mean age of 72.70 years (s.d.=0.74).

Data were available from 758-814 subjects for cognitive analysis, and 522-543 for mediation analysis with brain imaging data. APOE genotype was significantly associated with performance on several different tests of cognitive ability, including general factors of intelligence, information processing speed and memory (raw P-values all<0.05), independently of childhood IQ and vascular disease history. Formal tests of mediation showed that several significant APOE-cognitive ageing associations--particularly those related to tests of information processing speed--were partially mediated by white matter tract integrity. TOMM40 523 genotype was not associated with cognitive ageing.

Secondly, a bifactor model examined the unique influence of each cognitive ability when controlling for a general cognitive factor. Importantly, both a general cognitive factor (g; beta = -0.561, p < .001) and additional g-independent variance from processing speed (beta = -0.464, p < .001) contributed to successful TMT-B performance.

T1-weighted high-resolution (1 x 1 x 1mm(3) ) images were acquired. Voxel-based analysis was conducted to identify clusters showing tissue concentration differences with t-tests. Cognitive function was assessed using a standard clinical battery focused on executive function and memory. RESULTS: Two MA and two SE were unable to complete the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. Both SE and MA showed lower gray matter (GM) concentrations than YC in the superior, inferior and middle frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and the cingulate gyrus (PFDR-corrected < 0.001) and lower white matter (WM) concentrations in the inferior frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus (PFDR-corrected < 0.005). Notably, MA showed higher GM and WM concentrations than SE in the subgyral, cuneus, and precuneus regions related to visuospatial function, motor control, and working memory (PFDR-corrected < 0.005).

Therefore, the present study was conducted in an attempt to bridge a gap that involved investigating 'age-sensitive' cognitive abilities that may predict inattentional blindness in a sample of older adults. We investigated whether individual differences in general fluid intelligence and speed of processing would predict inattentional blindness in our sample of older adults. Thirty-six healthy older adults took part in the study. Using the inattentional blindness paradigm developed by Most et al. (Psychol Rev 112:217, 2005), we investigated whether rates of inattentional blindness could be predicted by participant's performance on the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices and a choice-reaction time task. A Mann-Whitney U test revealed that a higher score on the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices was significantly associated with lower incidences of inattentional blindness. However, a t test revealed that choice-reaction times were not significantly associated with inattentional blindness. Preliminary results from the present study suggest that individual differences in general fluid intelligence are predictive of inattentional blindness in older adults but not speed of processing. Moreover, our findings are consistent with previous studies that have suggested executive attention control may be the source of these individual differences. These findings also highlight the association between attention and general fluid intelligence and how it may impact environmental awareness.

            "Brain growth and development are critically dependent on several micronutrients. During early development cellular activity may be sensitive to micronutrient deficiencies, however the evidence from human studies is equivocal. The objective of this study was to examine the long-term cognitive and social-emotional effects of multiple micronutrient supplementation compared with iron supplementation alone, administered during infancy. This study was a follow-up to an initial randomized, double-blind controlled trial (RCT) in 2010 in which 902 infants, aged 6-17 months, from Lima, Peru, were given daily supplements of either iron (Fe) or multiple micronutrients (MMN) including zinc (451 in each group). The supplementation period for both groups was six months. In 2012, a subsample of 184 children from the original cohort (now aged 36-48 months) was randomly selected to participate in a follow-up trial and was assessed for intelligence, working memory, inhibition, and executive function. The tests showed no significant differences between the supplementation groups though there were some gender differences, with girls displaying higher scores than boys across both groups on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) Verbal IQ sentences subtest, the Day-Night cognitive test and on the Brief Infant-Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) social competency, and boys scoring higher than girls in problem behaviour. The results indicate that MMN supplementation had no long term additional effects on cognitive function compared with iron supplementation alone. The timing of supplement administration for maximum impact on a child's cognitive development requires further investigation.\n",

Few studies have examined the effect of maternal and infant micronutrient supplementation on development outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We conducted a follow-up study of two randomized trials of antenatal and infant micronutrient supplementation conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We assessed the effect of maternal multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation in pregnancy on development of children at 11-14 years of age. We also examined the effect of infant zinc and MMN supplementation on development at 6-8 years of age. We used generalized linear models to assess standardized mean differences (SMDs) in general intelligence, executive function, and mental health scores. RESULTS: We followed up 446 children whose mothers were enrolled in the maternal MMN supplementation trial and 365 children who were enrolled in the infant zinc and MMN supplementation trial. We found no effect of maternal MMN supplementation on general intelligence (SMD: -0.03; 95% CI: -0.15, 0.09), executive function (SMD: 0.00; 95% CI: -0.11, 0.11), and mental health scores (SMD: 0.06; 95% CI: 10.10, 0.22). We also found no effect of either infant zinc or MMN supplementation on any of the three development domains (p-values > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We found that antenatal MMN supplementation and infant zinc and MMN supplementation did not have a large effect on development outcomes in middle childhood and early adolescence in Tanzania.\n",

Studies conducted in both developing and developed countries, and trials that investigate the effect of both single and multiple micronutrient intervention were reviewed. METHODS: Systematic searches of Medline, CINAHL Plus and Academic Search database were undertaken to identify trials published after year 2000. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluate the effect of micronutrients on cognitive performance or academic performance among children aged 4-18 years were included. RESULTS: 19 trials were identified from 18 articles. The major cognitive outcomes assessed included fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, short-term memory, long-term memory, cognitive processing speed, attention and concentration, and school performance. Eight of ten trials assessing fluid intelligence reported significant positive effects of micronutrient supplementation among micronutrient-deficient children, especially those who were iron-deficient or iodine-deficient at baseline. The effects of micronutrient interventions on other domains were inconsistent. CONCLUSION: Improvement in fluid intelligence among micronutrient-deficient children was consistently reported.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term association of antenatal micronutrient supplementation with adolescent intellectual development. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 14-year follow-up study of a randomized clinical trial of micronutrient supplementation in pregnancy was conducted in 2 counties in rural western China in 2118 adolescent offspring (aged 10 to 14 years) of mothers who were randomized to take a daily capsule of either folic acid, folic acid plus iron, or multiple micronutrients from August 1, 2002, through February 28, 2006. Follow-up was conducted from June 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016. Data analyses took place from April 1, 2017, to June 20, 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adolescent full-scale intelligence quotient and aspects of verbal comprehension, working memory, perceptual reasoning, and processing speed indexes were assessed by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. RESULTS: Of 2118 adolescent offspring, 1252 (59.1%) were boys and 866 (40.9%) were girls, with a mean (SD) age of 11.7 (0.87) years, representing 47.2% of the 4488 single live births that were eligible to participate. Compared with folic acid supplementation, multiple micronutrient supplementation was associated with a 1.13-point higher full-scale intelligence quotient (95% CI, 0.15-2.10) and a 2.03-point higher verbal comprehension index (95% CI, 0.61-3.45); similar results were found in comparison with folic acid plus iron. When mothers initiated supplementation early (<12 weeks of gestation) and had an adequate dose (>/=180 capsules), multiple micronutrient capsules were associated with a 2.16-point higher full-scale intelligence quotient (95% CI, 0.41-3.90) and 4.29-point higher verbal comprehension index (95% CI, 1.33-7.24) compared with folic acid capsules. The mean test scores were lower in the substratum of supplementation initiated late (>/=12 weeks of gestation) and with an inadequate dose (<180 capsules). The multiple micronutrient group had higher scores than the other 2 treatment groups, and significant differences were observed for full-scale intelligence quotient (adjusted mean difference, 2.46; 95% CI, 0.98-3.94) when compared with the folic acid plus iron group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with folic acid plus iron or folic acid capsules supplementation, antenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation appeared to be associated with increased adolescent intellectual development; initiating supplementation in the first trimester and then continuing for at least 180 days were associated with the greatest rewards.

METHODS: Twenty-nine participants with schizophrenia (SCZ) and 23 healthy controls (HC) completed tasks measuring visual integration (Coherent Motion Task, Contour Integration Task), an eye-contact perception task, and a measure of emotional intelligence. RESULTS: SCZ participants showed compromised visual integration as suggested by poorer performance on the Contour Integration Task relative to HC. Visual integration was a significant predictor of eye-contact perception and emotional intelligence among SCZ. The amounts of variances in these 2 social cognitive areas accounted for by visual integration were comparable to and overlapped with those accounted for by the diagnosis of schizophrenia.

            "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by significant social functioning impairments, including (but not limited to) emotion recognition, mentalizing, and joint attention. Despite extensive investigation into the correlates of social functioning in ASD, only recently has there been focus on the role of low-level sensory input, particularly visual processing. Extensive gaze deficits have been described in ASD, from basic saccadic function through to social attention and the processing of complex biological motion. Given that social functioning often relies on accurately processing visual information, inefficient visual processing may contribute to the emergence and sustainment of social functioning difficulties in ASD. To explore the association between measures of gaze and social functioning in ASD, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. A total of 95 studies were identified from a search of CINAHL Plus, Embase, OVID Medline, and psycINFO databases in July 2021. Findings support associations between increased gaze to the face/head and eye regions with improved social functioning and reduced autism symptom severity. However, gaze allocation to the mouth appears dependent on social and emotional content of scenes and the cognitive profile of participants. This review supports the investigation of gaze variables as potential biomarkers of ASD, although future longitudinal studies are required to investigate the developmental progression of this relationship and to explore the influence of heterogeneity in ASD clinical characteristics. LAY SUMMARY: This review explored how eye gaze (e.g., where a person looks when watching a movie) is associated with social functioning in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We found evidence that better social functioning in ASD was associated with increased eye gaze toward faces/head and eye regions. Individual characteristics (e.g., intelligence) and the complexity of the social scene also influenced eye gaze. Future research including large longitudinal studies and studies investigating the influence of differing presentations of ASD are recommended.\n",

            "OBJECTIVES: Deficits in social cognition predict poor functional outcome in severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. However, research findings on social cognition in bipolar disorder (BD) are sparse and inconsistent. This study aimed to characterize a critical social cognitive process-eye gaze perception-and examine its functional correlates in BD to inform psychopathological mechanisms. METHODS: Thirty participants with BD, 37 healthy controls (HC), and 46 psychiatric controls with schizophrenia (SZ) completed an eye-contact perception task. They viewed faces with varying gaze directions, head orientations, and emotion, and made eye-contact judgments. Psychophysics methods were used to estimate perception thresholds and the slope of the perception curve, which were then compared between the groups and correlated with clinical and functional measures using Bayesian inference. RESULTS: Compared with HC, patients with BD over-perceived eye contact when gaze direction was ambiguous, and this self-referential bias was similar to that in SZ. Patients with BD had lower thresholds (i.e., needed weaker eye-contact signal to start perceiving gaze as self-directed) but a similar slope compared with HC. Regression analyses showed that steeper slope predicted better socio-emotional functioning in HC and SZ, but not in BD. CONCLUSIONS: The psychopathology of social dysfunction was fundamentally different between BD and SZ in this modest sample. Eye gaze perception in BD was characterized by a self-referential bias but preserved perceptual sensitivity, the latter of which distinguished BD from SZ. The relationship between gaze perception and broader socio-emotional functioning in SZ and HC was absent in BD.\n",

There is very limited knowledge about visual-motor integration in children with PWS. METHOD: Seventy-three children with PWS aged 7-17 years were included. Visual-motor integration was assessed using the Beery Visual-motor Integration test at the start of the study and after 2 years. The association between visual-motor integration and age, gender, genetic subtype and intelligence was assessed. RESULTS: Children with PWS scored 'very low' (-3 standard deviations) in visual-motor integration and 'below average' (-1 standard deviation) in visual perception and motor coordination compared with typically developing children. Visual-motor integration was higher in children with a deletion (beta = -0.170, P = 0.037), in older children (beta = 0.222, P = 0.009) and in those with a higher total IQ (beta = 0.784, P < 0.001). Visual perception was higher with a deletion (beta = -0.193, P = 0.044) and higher IQ (beta = -0.618, P < 0.001), but motor coordination was only higher with a higher total IQ (beta = 0.429, P = 0.001). Visual perception and motor coordination were not associated with age or gender. There was a trend for visual-motor integration decline over the 2 year follow-up period (P = 0.099). Visual perception and motor coordination did not change over the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Visual-motor integration is very poor in children with PWS. Children scored higher on the time-limited subtests for visual perception and motor coordination than the combined test for visual-motor integration. Separation of visual-motor integration tasks into pure visual or motor tasks and allowing sufficient time to perform the tasks might improve daily activities, both at home and at school.\n",

However, it is not known whether the gray matter (GM) volume in the striatum is also sensitive in differentiating vulnerability from disease manifestation in HD families from a South-American region known to have high incidence of the disease. In addition, the association of enlarged brain perivascular spaces (PVS) with cognitive, behavioral, and motor symptoms of HD is unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have analyzed neuroimaging indicators of global atrophy, PVS burden, and GM tissue volume in the basal ganglia and thalami, in relation to behavioral, motor, and cognitive scores, in 15 HD patients with overt disease manifestation and 14 first-degree relatives not genetically tested, which represent a vulnerable group, from the region of Magdalena, Colombia. RESULTS: Poor fluid intelligence as per the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices was associated with global brain atrophy (p = 0.002) and PVS burden (p </= 0.02) in HD patients, where the GM volume in all subcortical structures, with the exception of the right globus pallidus, was associated with motor or cognitive scores. Only the GM volume in the right putamen was associated with envy and MOCA scores (p = 0.008 and 0.015 respectively) in first-degree relatives. CONCLUSION: Striatal GM volume, global brain atrophy and PVS burden may serve as differential indicators of disease manifestation in HD. The Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices could be a cognitive test worth to consider in the differentiation of vulnerability versus overt disease in HD.\n",

Subjects harbour an increased risk for tumor development, with thyroid carcinoma occurring in young children. Establishing a diagnosis is challenging, since not all children fulfill diagnostic criteria established for adults. Macrocephaly is a common feature in childhood, with cerebral MRI being part of its diagnostic workup. We asked whether distinct cMRI features might facilitate an earlier diagnosis. METHODS: We retrospectively studied radiological and clinical data of pediatric patients who were presented in our hospital between 2013 and 2019 in whom PTEN gene mutations were identified. RESULTS: We included 27 pediatric patients (18 male) in the analysis. All patients were macrocephalic. Of these, 19 patients had received at least one cMRI scan. In 18 subjects variations were detected: enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS; in 18), white matter abnormalities (in seven) and less frequently additional pathologies. Intellectual ability was variable. Most patients exhibited developmental delay in motor skills, but normal intelligence. CONCLUSION: cMRI elucidates EPVS and white matter abnormalities in a high prevalence in children with PHTS and might therefore aid as a diagnostic feature to establish an earlier diagnosis of PHTS in childhood.\n",

We examined possible associations of CSO-PVS volume and count with brain IDs and cognitive abilities in 700 community-dwelling individuals from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 who underwent detailed cognitive testing and multimodal brain MRI at mean age 72.7 years. Brain IDs were assessed automatically followed by manual editing. PVS were automatically assessed in the centrum semiovale and deep corona radiata supraventricular. General factors of overall cognitive function (g), processing speed (g-speed) and memory (g-memory) were used in the analyses. Median (IQR) volumes of IDs and CSO-PVS expressed as a percentage of intracranial volume were 0.0021 (0.011) and 0.22 (0.13)% respectively. Median count of CSO-PVS was 410 (IQR = 201). Total volumes of CSO-PVS and ID, adjusted for head size, were correlated (Spearman rho = 0.13, p < 0.001). CSO-PVS volume, despite being correlated with all three cognitive measures, was only associated with g-memory (B = -114.5, SE = 48.35, p = 0.018) in general linear models, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, childhood intelligence and white matter hyperintensity volume. The interaction of CSO-PVS count with diabetes (B = -0.0019, SE = 0.00093, p = 0.041) and volume with age (B = 1.57, SE = 0.67, p = 0.019) were also associated with g-memory. Linear regression models did not replicate these associations. Therefore, it does not seem that CSO-PVS burden is directly associated with general cognitive ability in older age.\n",

            "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The cavum septum pellucidum, a cavity filled with CSF, is localized between the 2 lateral ventricles of the brain. The cavum is present in all neonates, but it typically closes within 5 months after birth. In some cases, this closure does not occur and a persistent or enlarged cavum septum pellucidum has been linked, in some studies, to psychiatric disorders. However, the clinical relevance in the general population is unknown. In this study, we examined the relationship between the cavum septum pellucidum and volumes of brain structures, cognitive function, and emotional and behavioral problems in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was embedded in the Generation R Study, a prospective cohort in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. MR imaging studies of 1070 children, 6-10 years of age, were systematically evaluated for the presence and length of a persistent cavum septum pellucidum. An enlarged cavum septum pellucidum was defined as a cavum length of >/=6 mm. Groups without, with persistent, and with enlarged cavum septi pellucidi were compared for brain structure volumes, nonverbal intelligence, and emotional and behavioral problems. RESULTS: The prevalence of cavum septi pellucidi in our sample was 4.6%. Children with an enlarged cavum septum pellucidum had a larger corpus callosum, greater thalamic and total white matter-to-total brain volume ratio, and smaller lateral ventricle volumes. We did not find a relationship between cavum septi pellucidi and cognitive function or emotional and behavioral problems. CONCLUSIONS: The cavum septum pellucidum is a normal structural brain variation without clinical implications in this population-based sample of school-aged children.\n",

Striatal and thalamic abnormalities have been associated with childhood-onset epilepsies, suggesting that epilepsy-related changes in the subcortical circuit might be associated with the comorbidities of children with epilepsy. We aimed to compare subcortical volumes and their relationship with age in children with complex partial seizures (CPS), childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), and healthy controls (HC). We examined the shared versus unique structural-functional relationships of these volumes with behavior problems, intelligence, language, peer interaction, and epilepsy variables in these two epilepsy syndromes. METHODS: We investigated volumetric differences of caudate, putamen, pallidum, and thalamus in children with CPS (N = 21), CAE (N = 20), and HC (N = 27). Study subjects underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), intelligence, and language testing. Parent-completed Child Behavior Checklists provided behavior problem and peer interaction scores. We examined the association of age, intelligence quotient (IQ), language, behavioral problems, and epilepsy variables with subcortical volumes that were significantly different between the children with epilepsy and HC. KEY FINDINGS: Both children with CPS and CAE exhibited significantly smaller left thalamic volume compared to HC. In terms of developmental trajectory, greater thalamic volume was significantly correlated with increasing age in children with CPS and CAE but not in HC. With regard to the comorbidities, reduced left thalamic volumes were related to more social problems in children with CPS and CAE. Smaller left thalamic volumes in children with CPS were also associated with poor attention, lower IQ and language scores, and impaired peer interaction. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study is the first to directly compare and detect shared thalamic structural abnormalities in children with CPS and CAE. These findings highlight the vulnerability of the thalamus and provide important new insights on its possible role in the neurobehavioral comorbidities of childhood-onset epilepsy.\n",

This study focused on patients with ASD with intellectual disabilities, defined by a threshold intelligence quotient (IQ) or development quotient (DQ) of 70. We also discuss comorbidities and other factors related to ASD. METHODS: We extracted case records of patients born between April 1995 and March 2001 who lived in Yonago City, as of January 2011, and had visited the two specialist institutions for consultation regarding developmental issues. The list was further narrowed down to patients identified, as having ASD by pediatric neurologists based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) (DSM-5). We selected patients with < IQ/DQ 70 using the most recent intelligence/development test to determine comorbidities and other factors related to ASD. RESULTS: The data of 81 patients (59 males and 22 females) were extracted, corresponding to an incidence of 76.2 patients out of every 10,000 births. The male-to-female ratio was 2.7:1. Comorbidities and related factors of ASD were observed in 25 cases (30.9%). Eleven cases had perinatal abnormalities. Other abnormalities were observed in 17 cases, including epilepsies in 7, chromosomal abnormalities in 4, familial mental retardation in 1, and acquired brain injury in 1. CONCLUSION: It is important to treat and support individuals with ASD and intellectual disabilities taking into account the characteristics and prognosis of the comorbidities and related factors.\n",

            "Tensor-Based Morphometry (TBM) allows the automatic mapping of brain changes across time building 3D deformation maps. This technique has been applied for tracking brain degeneration in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases with high sensitivity and reliability. Here we applied TBM to quantify changes in brain structure after completing a challenging adaptive cognitive training program based on the n-back task. Twenty-six young women completed twenty-four training sessions across twelve weeks and they showed, on average, large cognitive improvements. High-resolution MRI scans were obtained before and after training. The computed longitudinal deformation maps were analyzed for answering three questions: (a) Are there differential brain structural changes in the training group as compared with a matched control group? (b) Are these changes related to performance differences in the training program? (c) Are standardized changes in a set of psychological factors (fluid and crystallized intelligence, working memory, and attention control) measured before and after training, related to structural changes in the brain? Results showed (a) greater structural changes for the training group in the temporal lobe, (b) a negative correlation between these changes and performance across training sessions (the greater the structural change, the lower the cognitive performance improvements), and (c) negligible effects regarding the psychological factors measured before and after training.\n",

However, the role of interconnecting white matter pathways including the fornix, cingulum, and uncinate fasciculus (UF) is less well studied. OBJECTIVE: To assess MS damage to a hippocampal-thalamic-prefrontal network and the relative contributions of its components to specific cognitive domains. METHODS: We calculated diffusion tensor fractional anisotropy (FA) in the fornix, cingulum and UF as well as thalamic and hippocampal volumes in 27 RRMS patients and 20 healthy controls. A neuropsychological battery was administered and 4 core tests known to be sensitive to MS changes were used to assess cognitive impairment. To determine the relationships between structure and cognition, all tests were grouped into 4 domains: attention/executive function, processing speed, verbal memory, and spatial memory. Univariate correlations with structural measures and depressive symptoms identified potential contributors to cognitive performance and subsequent linear regression determined their relative effects on performance in each domain. For significant predictors, we also explored the effects of laterality and axial versus radial diffusivity. RESULTS: RRMS patients had worse performance on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, but no significant impairment in the 4 cognitive domains. RRMS had reduced mean FA of all 3 pathways and reduced thalamic and hippocampal volumes compared to controls. In RRMS we found that thalamic volume and BDI predicted attention/executive function, UF FA predicted processing speed, thalamic volume predicted verbal memory, and UF FA and BDI predicted spatial memory. CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal-thalamic-prefrontal disruption affects cognitive performance in early RRMS with mild to minimal cognitive impairment, confirming both white and gray matter involvement in MS and demonstrating utility in assessing functional networks to monitor cognition.\n",

METHODS: Six women with acromegaly who became pregnant under follow-up between 2010 and 2014 and their 16 children (group A) were assessed and compared with 16 children of healthy women (group B) and 15 children of women with prolactinoma (group C). The physical examinations of children were performed by the department of pediatric endocrinology and intelligence quotient (IQ) testing was undertaken by adult and pediatric psychiatry departments, using appropriate scales for their ages. RESULTS: Six of the 16 children (girls/boys: 7/9) were born after the diagnosis of acromegaly. Five of the 6 pregnancies occured when the patients were taking somatostatin analogs, none continued taking the drugs during pregnancy. The mean IQ of groups A, B, and C were 106.4 +/- 12.5, 105.3 +/- 12.5, and 103.2 +/- 16.1 respectively (p > 0.05).

METHODS: Fifty-nine children 2-18 years (30 girls, 29 boys) with unilateral arterial ischemic stroke or spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage at least 6 months before evaluation were enrolled from a single center. The PedsQL version 4.0 Generic Short Form and PedsQL version 3.0 Cerebral Palsy Module were administered to childhood stroke subjects and parents. Generic PedsQL Inventory scores were compared between children with stroke and published data from healthy children. Reported health status scores for children with varying degrees of hemiparesis were compared. RESULTS: Children with stroke had lower reported health status scores on the Generic PedsQL Inventory than healthy children. Children with moderate-severe hemiparesis had worse scores than children without hemiparesis on several measures of the Cerebral Palsy Module as reported by both parents and children. The parents of children with epilepsy reported worse scores on several measures compared with children without epilepsy, and the parent scores were lower on several measures for children with lower intelligence quotients. Agreement between parent and child scores was better on the Cerebral Palsy Module than on the Generic Inventory. CONCLUSIONS: Children with stroke have worse reported health status than healthy controls.

Based on these findings, we aim to investigate if the association between educational achievement in parents and intelligence in their offspring is influenced by schizophrenia or mood disorder in parents. In a large population-based sample of young adult male conscripts (n = 156,531) the presence of a mental disorder in the parents were associated with significantly lower offspring scores on a test of general intelligence, the Borge Priens Prove (BPP), and higher educational attainment in parents was significantly associated with higher BPP test scores in offspring. A significant interaction suggested that the positive association between maternal education and offspring intelligence was stronger in offspring of mothers with schizophrenia compared to the control group (p = 0.03). The associations between parental education and offspring intelligence are also observed when restricting the sample to conscripts whose parents are diagnosed after 30 years of age. In conclusion, findings from this study show a more positive effect of education on offspring intelligence in mothers with schizophrenia compared to mothers from the control group.

AIM: Our objective was to compare the intelligence quotient (IQ) of children whose mothers had been diagnosed with SCH prenatally with matched controls using a case-control retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a previous study from our group, 1000 healthy nulliparous women were screened anonymously for SCH. This was a laboratory diagnosis involving elevated TSH with normal fT4 or normal TSH with hypothyroxinaemia. We identified 23 cases who agreed to participate. These were matched with 47 controls. All children underwent neurodevelopmental assessment at age 7-8. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children IV assessment scores were used to compare the groups. Our main outcome measure was to identify whether there was a difference in IQ between the groups. RESULTS: From the cohort of cases, 23 mothers agreed to the assessment of their children as well as 47 controls. The children in the control group had higher mean scores than those in the case group across Verbal Comprehension Intelligence, Perceptual Reasoning Intelligence, Working Memory Intelligence, Processing Speed Intelligence and Full Scale IQ. Mann-Whitney U-test confirmed a significant difference in IQ between the cases (composite score 103.87) and the controls (composite score 109.11) with a 95% confidence interval (0.144, 10.330).

RESULTS: The results of one-way analysis of variance indicated significant differences among the subgroups for the \"Gross and fine motor\" subdomains of the Comprehensive Developmental Inventory for Infants and Toddlers, especially on the subtests of \"body-movement coordination\" (F=3.87, P<0.05) and \"visual-motor coordination\" (F=6.90, P<0.05). Motor competence was significantly worse in the VIQ>PIQ group than in the NON and PIQ>VIQ groups. Significant negative correlations between IQD and most of the motor subtests (r=0.31-0.46, P<0.01) were found only in the VIQ>PIQ group. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that 1) IQD indicates the level of motor competence in preschoolers at risk for developmental delays and 2) IQD is negatively associated with motor competence in preschoolers with significant VIQ>PIQ discrepancy. The first finding was that preschoolers with VIQ>PIQ discrepancy greater than 1 SD performed significantly worse on motor competence than did preschoolers without significant IQD and preschoolers with PIQ>VIQ discrepancy greater than 1 SD. However, preschoolers with significant PIQ>VIQ discrepancy performed better on motor competence than did preschoolers without significant IQD, though the difference was not statistically significant. The second finding was that preschoolers with larger VIQ>PIQ discrepancy had worse motor competence in visual-motor integration and body-movement coordination. Professionals should pay attention to the motor development of children with VIQ>PIQ discrepancy and evaluate children's IQD along with their motor competence.\n",

METHODS: A total of 127 ASD preschool-aged children were divided into three groups according to the size of the IQD: IQD within 1 standard deviation (1SD; EVENIQ; n=81), discrepantly higher verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ; n=22; VIQ>performance intelligence quotient [PIQ] above 1SD [>/=15 points]), and discrepantly higher PIQ (n=24; PIQ>VIQ above 1SD [>/=15 points]). Children's IQD and motor skills were determined with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - Fourth Edition and the motor subtests of the Comprehensive Developmental Inventory for Infants and Toddlers (CDIIT), respectively. RESULTS: One-way analysis of variance revealed significant group differences for the fine motor domain of the CDIIT and the visual-motor coordination subtest (F=3.37-4.38, p<0.05). Children with discrepantly higher PIQ were associated with better fine motor skills than were children with even IQD and those with discrepantly higher VIQ, and vice versa. IQD (PIQ - VIQ) had significant positive correlations with the fine motor domain and fine motor subtests of the CDIIT (r=0.18-0.29, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The IQD can identify different levels of fine motor skills in preschool-aged children with ASD. This study suggests important implications for clinicians, therapists, and researchers: discrepantly higher PIQ could be related to better visual-motor coordination, and discrepantly higher VIQ could be related to poor visual-motor coordination. Furthermore, the results support that when therapists are working with preschool-aged children with ASD who are developing fine motor skills or undertaking fine motor tasks related to visual-motor coordination, they may need to pay attention to the children's IQD.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to p,p'-DDE is associated with impairments in motor development during the first year of life, with no related repercussions on mental or motor development at 12-30 months and with impairments in cognitive areas, but not in perceptual and motor areas at preschool age. However, its association with particular psychomotor factors, such as establishment of lateralization and spatial orientation, essential elements to the overall learning and specifically reading, writing and spelling in preschoolers, has not been independently evaluated, since cognitive and motor areas have only been explored globally. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between prenatal exposure to p,p'-DDE and the establishment of lateralization and spatial orientation in children 5 years of age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Establishment of lateralization and spatial orientation was evaluated using the McCarthy Scale of Children's Abilities, with 167 children 5 years of age who participated in a birth cohort in the state of Morelos, Mexico. The information available for each child included: serum concentrations of p,p'-DDE of the mother during at least one trimester of pregnancy, mothers' intelligence quotients, stimulation at home and anthropometry. A logistic regression model was used to calculate the association between prenatal exposure to p,p'-DDE and lateralization and a multiple linear regression model was used for the association with spatial orientation. RESULTS: A two-fold increase in p,p'-DDE in lipid base during the second trimester of pregnancy was associated with a significant reduction, -0.18 points (95% CI -0.41; 0.04, in the spatial orientation index, with no impairment in the establishment of hemispheric dominance. Attending preschool and the maternal intelligence quotient were the main determinants of spatial orientation and the establishment of hemispheric dominance. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to p,p'-DDE may affect the 5 year old's ability to identify spatial orientation of oneself and surrounding objects. Given the observed role of attending preschool in the functions studied, early attendance in formal education might serve as a stimulation strategy for preschoolers. These preliminary results should be verified and expanded in further prospective studies with DDE.\n",

Hence, a deeper understanding of predictors of child intelligence should suggest points of intervention for children facing adversities. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to examine the predictive value of demographic, perinatal and neonatal variables after birth and developmental characteristics at age 2 for 4-year intelligence as outcome among low birth weight children. METHODS: We designed a panel study with a 2-year follow-up with 114 child-mother pairs. The outcome variable was IQ intelligence quotient at 4 years of age of LBW low birth weight children measured by the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scales of Intelligence. Potential predictors were maternal education, family wealth, ethnic identity; sex, twin pregnancy, gestational age, birth weight, Apgar scores, maternal smoking during pregnancy; diagnosis of intravetricular haemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia after birth and cognitive, language and motor development at age 2 measured by one composite score of the three Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development aggregated. RESULTS: Stepwise backward regression was carried out including significant variables from the bivariate analysis. The best model included 4 predictors which accounted for 57% of the variance of the full IQ intelligence at 4-years of age. Maternal higher education was significant positive, below average family wealth and neonatal diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia were significant negative predictors in the model after birth. 2-year developmental characteristics such as cognitive, motor and language skills were positive predictors of the IQ intelligence at age 4. CONCLUSION: Sociodemographic assessment at birth and developmental assessment at two years of age are of crucial importance to recognize children at high risk for delayed cognitive development. High-risk children should be directed to supportive interventions and their development should be regulary monitored.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Difficulties in emotion regulation influence the development of substance use disorder (SUD), its severity, course, treatment outcomes, and relapse. Impaired executive functions (EFs) are common in SUD populations and may relate to emotion dysregulation. The current study tested whether performance on three basic EF tasks ('working memory', 'inhibition', and 'task-switching') and/or inventory-based assessment of EF were related to difficulties in emotion regulation in females attending residential SUD therapeutic community treatment. METHODS: Cross-sectional design in which participants (N=50, all female) completed a questionnaire battery including the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult Version (BRIEF-A) was used. Participants also completed neuropsychological assessment of EF including the Working Memory Index (WMI; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale), and measures of inhibition and task-switching (Color-Word Interference Test; Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System). RESULTS: Executive dysfunction, as assessed by the Global Executive Composite (GEC; BRIEF-A), and personality disorder indicators (Standardised Assessment of Personality - Abbreviated Scale; SAPAS) were positively correlated with DERS scores. Sequential hierarchical regression indicated that task-switching, GEC, and SAPAS scores statistically predicted DERS scores, while working memory and inhibition did not. Mediation analysis indicated that there was a significant indirect effect of GEC scores and task-switching performance on DERS scores, through SAPAS scores. CONCLUSIONS: Impairment of EF, particularly task-switching, is related to difficulties in emotion regulation in a female sample attending residential SUD treatment. Cognitive training interventions that improve task-switching performance may be beneficial in promoting effective emotion regulation and improved SUD treatment outcomes.\n",

This study investigated the cognitive underpinnings of math difficulties in children with SCD and SCI. METHOD: Youth (n = 68) with SCD and SCI completed measures of attention [Digit Span forward (DSF); Conners Continuous Performance Test-Third Edition/Kiddie Conners Continuous Performance Test-Second Edition (CPT-3/KCPT-2)]; working memory [Wechsler Intelligence Scales (WPPSI-IV, WISC-IV, WISC-V, WAIS-IV), Working Memory Index (WMI), Digit Span backwards (DSB)]; processing speed [WPPSI-IV, WISC-IV, WISC-V, WAIS-IV Processing Speed Index (PSI)]; math reasoning [Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-Third Edition (WIAT-III) Mathematics composite (MC)]; and math fluency [WIAT-III Math Fluency composite (MF)] as part of a clinical neuropsychological evaluation. Parent ratings of attention and executive functioning were obtained [Behavior Assessment System for Children-Third Edition (BASC-3), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)]. RESULTS: MC was positively correlated with WMI (r = 0.59, p = 0.00), PSI (r = 0.40, p < 0.001), DSF (r = 0.29, p = 0.03), DSB (r = 0.47, p < 0.001), and MF (r = 0.71, p < 0.001). Correlations between MC, sustained attention, and parent ratings were nonsignificant. The linear regression model using correlated variables was significant [F(4,51) = 8.29, R2 = 0.39, p < 0.001]. WMI was the only significant variable within the model (p = 0.02).

So far, no studies have been published on the effects of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors on cognitive functioning. We investigated the objective and subjective cognitive function of patients during treatment with VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR TKI). METHODS: Three groups of participants, matched on age, sex and education, were enrolled; 1. metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) or GIST patients treated with sunitinib or sorafenib (VEGFR TKI patients n = 30); 2. patients with mRCC not receiving systemic treatment (patient controls n = 20); 3. healthy controls (n = 30). Sixteen neuropsychological tests examining the main cognitive domains (intelligence, memory, attention and concentration, executive functions and abstract reasoning) were administered by a neuropsychologist. Four questionnaires were used to assess subjective cognitive complaints, mood, fatigue and psychological wellbeing. RESULTS: No significant differences in mean age, sex distribution, education level or IQ were found between the three groups. Both patient groups performed significantly worse on the cognitive domains Learning & Memory and Executive Functions (Response Generation and Problem Solving) compared to healthy controls. However only the VEGFR TKI patients showed impairments on the Executive subdomain Response Generation. Effect sizes of cognitive dysfunction in patients using VEGFR TKI were larger on the domains Learning & Memory and Executive Functions, compared to patient controls. Both patients groups performed on the domain Attention & Concentration the same as the healthy controls. Longer duration of treatment on VEGFR TKI was associated with a worse score on Working Memory tasks. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that treatment with VEGFR TKI has a negative impact on cognitive functioning, specifically on Learning & Memory, and Executive Functioning. We propose that patients who are treated with VEGFR TKI are monitored and informed for possible signs or symptoms associated with cognitive impairment.

This study investigated the validity of 10 PVT scores in justice-involved adults with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), a neurodevelopmental disability stemming from prenatal alcohol exposure and linked with severe neurocognitive deficits. METHOD: The sample comprised 80 justice-involved adults (ages 19-40) including 25 with confirmed or possible FASD and 55 where FASD was ruled out. Ten PVT scores were calculated, derived from Word Memory Test, Genuine Memory Impairment Profile, Advanced Clinical Solutions (Word Choice), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition (Reliable Digit Span and age-corrected scaled scores (ACSS) from Digit Span, Coding, Symbol Search, Coding - Symbol Search, Vocabulary - Digit Span), and the Wechsler Memory Scale - Fourth Edition (Logical Memory II Recognition). RESULTS: Participants with diagnosed/possible FASD were more likely to fail any single PVT, and failed a greater number of PVTs overall, compared to those without FASD. They were also more likely to fail based on Word Memory Test, Digit Span ACSS, Coding ACSS, Symbol Search ACSS, and Logical Memory II Recognition, compared to controls (35-76%). Across both groups, substantially more participants with IQ <70 failed two or more PVTs (90%), compared to those with an IQ >/=70 (44%).

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess complex multisensory emotion processing in CU in comparison to controls and to examine a potential association with drug use patterns. METHOD: The abbreviated version of the comprehensive affect testing system (CATS-A) was used to measure emotion perception across the three channels of facial affect, prosody, and semantic content in 58 CU and 48 healthy control (HC) subjects who were matched for age, sex, verbal intelligence, and years of education. RESULTS: CU had significantly lower scores than controls in the quotient scales of \"emotion recognition\" and \"prosody recognition\" and the subtests \"conflicting prosody/meaning - attend to prosody\" and \"match emotional prosody to emotional face\" either requiring to attend to prosody or to integrate cross-modal information.

            "OBJECTIVE: The correct production of speech depends on the effective use of inhibitory control. Cocaine abuse has been linked to impaired inhibition in the verbal and nonverbal domains. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible impairment of the inhibitory control process engaged in the production of language among chronic cocaine users, both in rehabilitation and recreational contexts. METHOD: Researchers obtained an index of semantic interference from a picture-word task performed by chronic cocaine users in rehabilitation (Experiment 1) and recreational cocaine polydrug users (Experiment 2). Cocaine users in both groups were matched for age and intelligence with cocaine-free health controls. Performance on the picture-word task was analyzed by repeated-measures analyses of variance. RESULTS: Both groups of cocaine users showed significantly more semantic interference than their respective cocaine-free control group. These results suggest a deficit in the ability to inhibit interfering information. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that cocaine use, even at recreational levels, is associated with specific impairments in the inhibitory mechanism that reduces the activation of overt competing responses in language production. This impairment results in the inefficient avoidance of irrelevant information, inducing errors and slower responses during the production of spoken language.\n",

            "OBJECTIVE: To examine trade-offs between cognitive outcome and overweight/obesity in preterm-born infants at school age and young adulthood in relation to weight gain and linear growth during infancy. STUDY DESIGN: We studied 945 participants in the Infant Health and Development Program, an 8-center study of preterm (</=37 weeks gestational age), low birth weight (</=2500 g) infants from birth to age 18 years. Adjusting for maternal and child factors in logistic regression, we estimated the odds of overweight/obesity (body mass index [BMI] >/=85th percentile at age 8 or >/=25 kg/m(2) at age 18) and in separate models, low IQ (<85) per z-score changes in infant length and BMI from term to 4 months, from 4 to 12 months, and from 12 to 18 months. RESULTS: More rapid linear growth from term to 4 months was associated with lower odds of IQ <85 at age 8 years (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70-0.96), but higher odds of overweight/obesity (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.05-1.53). More rapid BMI gain in all 3 infant time intervals was also associated with higher odds of overweight/obesity, and BMI gain from 4-12 months was associated with lower odds of IQ <85 at age 8. Results at age 18 were similar. CONCLUSION: In these preterm, low birth weight infants born in the 1980s, faster linear growth soon after term was associated with better cognition, but also with a greater risk of overweight/obesity at age 8 years and 18 years. BMI gain over the entire 18 months after term was associated with later risk of overweight/obesity, with less evidence of a benefit for IQ.\n",

STUDY DESIGN: Participants were VLBW (500-1250 g) children enrolled in the Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity randomized trial between 1999 and 2004. We investigated the relationships between 4 potential social advantages: higher maternal education, higher paternal education, caregiver employment, and 2 biologic parents in the same home--and gain in cognitive scores. Cognitive assessments were performed at the corrected ages of 18 months (Mental Development Index score on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II) and 5 years (Full Scale IQ on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence III). Cognitive gain was computed by subtracting each individual 18-month Mental Development Index score from the corresponding Full Scale IQ at 5 years. RESULTS: Data were available for 1347 children. Mean (SD) cognitive scores were 90.8 (15.7) at 18 months and 98.9 (14.5) at 5 years. Multivariable regression showed that higher maternal education, higher paternal education, and caregiver employment had independent and additive effects of similar size on cognitive gain (P < .001); the mean cognitive gain between 18 months and 5 years increased by 3.6 points in the presence of each of these advantages. When all 3 were present, cognitive scores improved on average by 10.9 points compared with children without any of these advantages. CONCLUSION: In VLBW children, a count of 3 social advantages strongly predicts gains in cognitive scores across the preschool years.\n",

METHODS: The ASQ was performed on 755 participants from the Irish BASELINE birth cohort at 24 or 27 months of age. Intelligence quotient was measured at age 5 with the Kaufmann Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition, and low cognitive ability was defined as a score more than 1 standard deviation below the mean. The ASQ's predictive value was examined, together with other factors associated with low cognitive ability at 5 years. RESULTS: When the ASQ was performed at 24 or 27 months, the overall sensitivity for identifying low cognitive ability at 5 years was 20.8% and the specificity was 91.1%. Using a total score cut-off point increased the sensitivity to 46.6% and 71.4% at 24 and 27 months, but specificity fell to 74.1% and 67.2%, respectively. After adjusting for ASQ performance, maternal education and family income were strongly associated with cognitive outcomes at 5 years.

Enhanced protein intake immediately after very preterm birth has been associated with favorable growth and improved neurodevelopment. It is unknown whether increased protein intake after discharge from the hospital affects long-term neurodevelopment. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to assess neurodevelopment from infancy to 8 years in preterm-born children who received either protein-enriched formula (PDF), standard term formula (TF), or human milk (HM) after discharge. The secondary objective was to assess the correlation between outcomes obtained at 24 months corrected age (CA) and at 8 years. METHODS: This RCT included 152 children born very preterm (gestational age </=32 weeks) and/or with a very low birth weight (</=1500 g) of whom 102 were randomly assigned to receive PDF (n = 54) or TF (n = 48) from term age to 6 months CA. A control group of infants fed HM (n = 50) was also included. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed at 24 months CA (cognitive and motor functioning; n = 123) and at 8 years (estimated Full Scale Intelligence Quotient, visual-motor skills, verbal memory, attention, and motor functioning; n = 76). RESULTS: The PDF and TF groups were not significantly different in neurodevelopmental outcomes. The HM group had a better cognitive score compared with the PDF group: at 24 months CA 92.9 +/- 12.5 vs. 105.2 +/- 18.6, P < 0.001 and at 8 years 98.1 +/- 11.3 vs. 105.8 +/- 9.1, P = 0.017 (P = 0.002 and P = 0.080, respectively, after adjustment for parental educational level). Correlations between outcomes at 24 months CA and 8 years were weak: r = 0.35 and r = 0.37 for cognitive and motor outcomes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PDF did not improve long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes as compared with TF. However, these results should be interpreted with caution considering the substantial attrition at follow-up. Furthermore, the correlation between outcomes at different ages was weak, emphasizing the need for long-term follow-up of nutritional intervention studies in preterm-born children.\n",

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for 82 preterm infants who were born in the Department of Obstetrics of the First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017, and these infants were hospitalized after birth in the Department of Neonatology of the hospital. They were regularly followed up to observe growth and development and thyroid function at the outpatient service of the Department of Neonatology. According to thyroid function test results, they were divided into an abnormal thyroid function group (observation group; n=31) and a normal thyroid function group (control group; n=51). The infants in the observation group were given oral administration of levothyroxine sodium tablets, while those in the control group were not given any treatment. The two groups were compared in terms of the physical and intelligence development and thyroid function of preterm infants with various gestational ages (28-<32 weeks, 32-<34 weeks, and 34-<37 weeks) after regular follow-up to the corrected age of 12 months. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in physical development indices (body length, body weight, and head circumference) between the observation and control groups at various gestational ages after follow-up to the corrected age of 12 months (P>0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the scores of each functional area of the Gesell Developmental Scale among the preterm infants with a gestational age of 28-<32 weeks and 32-<34 weeks after follow-up to the corrected age of 12 months (P>0.05). For the preterm infants with a gestational age of 34-<37 weeks, compared with the control group, the observation group had a significantly lower score of gross motor ability at the age of 3 and 12 months, significantly lower scores of fine motor ability, language ability, and adaptation ability at the age of 12 months (P<0.05), and a significantly lower score of personal-social ability at the age of 3 months (P<0.05). However, the score of personal-social ability in the observation group was not significantly different from the control group at the age of 12 months (P>0.05). After 2-4 weeks of treatment with levothyroxine sodium tablets, the thyroid function of the 31 preterm infants with thyroid dysfunction returned to normal. Among the 31 infants, 21 (68%) achieved complete drug withdrawal, with normal results of neonatal screening (100%); 10 infants (32%) failed to achieve drug withdrawal, and only 2 (20%) out of the 10 infants had normal neonatal screening results (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and reasonable treatment can reduce the impact on growth and development in preterm infants with thyroid dysfunction. Most preterm infants tend to have transient thyroid dysfunction, while those with positive results of neonatal screening are more likely to develop permanent thyroid dysfunction.\n",

OBJECTIVE: To explore the differences in psychometric scores for cognition and motor skills when they are age-standardized according to chronological age instead of corrected age for children born preterm. METHODS: We assessed = 554 children born <33 weeks' gestation with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd edition (mental and motor scores) at 18 months and the Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (IQ score) at seven years of age. Scores were standardized according to chronological age and corrected age and differences between mean chronological and corrected scores were compared, along with the proportion of children whose scores could be classified as impaired. RESULTS: When scores were standardized according to chronological age instead of corrected age there was a large significant difference of 17.3 points on the mental scale (79.5 vs. 96.8, respectively) and 11.8 points on the motor scale (84.8 vs. 96.6, respectively) at 18 months. By seven years, the difference in IQ scores remained, although of a smaller magnitude at 1.9 points between mean chronological and corrected age scoring (97.2 vs. 99.1, respectively). CONCLUSION: Consistent with previous literature, outcome assessments for preterm infants consistently differed according to use of chronological or corrected age to standardized scores. Cognitive scores were impacted more severely than motor scores, and differences were more substantial in early childhood than later in childhood. For clinical purposes, correction for preterm birth is only likely to have an impact during early childhood, however assessments for research purposes should continue to correct into childhood to account for the persistent bias due to preterm birth.\n",

RESULTS: Twins and singletons had otherwise similar perinatal background factors, except for the higher proportion of preterm rupture of membranes in singletons. Twins had cognitive and neuropsychological outcomes that were otherwise comparable with singletons, but they had a slightly lower verbal intelligence quotient (estimate -5.81, 95% CI -11.14 to -0.48, p = 0.03).

Frequent reading of books, but not of magazines, was associated with higher levels of verbal fluency and recall but unrelated to rate of longitudinal decline. Subgroup analyses indicated that the g factor in early adulthood predicted reading and cognitive level in midlife and this factor removed the current association between reading habits and level of cognitive ability (both cognitive factors). The results indicate an enduring relationship between book reading and level of cognitive ability across the adult life span and provide little support of the hypothesis that frequent reading protects against late-life cognitive decline.

With and without covariate adjustment, HS was significant across the life span though its pattern changed. HS increased linearly and highly significantly until late senescence. Only in early adulthood did VIQ appear to vacate the right temporal lobe and occupy the left and PIQ vacate the left parietal lobe and occupy the right until late senescence. Biomaturational factors are more important in the ontogeny of material-specific HS over the whole life span than previously established.\n",

Therefore, the purpose of this study was is to determine the effect of emotional intelligence on the quality of life of elderly diabetic patients. METHODS: This study was conducted in 2018. The statistical population in this cross-sectional study consisted of elderly people referred to the health centers of Kermanshah province in western Iran, who were divided via available sampling into two groups with diabetes and without diabetes. Data gathering tools were a couple of LIPAD Quality of Life and Shrink Emotional Intelligence standard questionnaires. The Data was analysed using software SPSS, 23 th version. Tests were used (T-test, Chi-square, Anova and regression). RESULTS: Most of them were male (52.72%) and the mean age of the patients was 65.01(+/-6.08) years old and married. The quality of life score in diabetics and non-diabetics was respectively 51.9 and 50.37 with a standard deviation of 17.73 and 20.54. The mean total score of emotional intelligence in the elderly with diabetes was 99.42 with a standard deviation of 10.37 and non-diabetic subjects were 97.18 with a standard deviation of 18.4. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between the mean scores of quality of life (0.652) and emotional intelligence (0.421) in diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.

            "OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the performance of the Predictive OpTimal Trees in Emergency Surgery Risk (POTTER) tool in elderly emergency surgery (ES) patients. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The POTTER tool was derived using a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-methodology called optimal classification trees and validated for prediction of ES outcomes. POTTER outperforms all existent risk-prediction models and is available as an interactive smartphone application. Predicting outcomes in elderly patients has been historically challenging and POTTER has not yet been tested in this population. METHODS: All patients >/=65 years who underwent ES in the ACS-NSQIP 2017 database were included. POTTER's performance for 30-day mortality and 18 postoperative complications (eg, respiratory or renal failure) was assessed using c-statistic methodology, with planned sub-analyses for patients 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85+ years. RESULTS: A total of 29,366 patients were included, with mean age 77, 55.8% females, and 62% who underwent emergency general surgery. POTTER predicted mortality accurately in all patients over 65 (c-statistic 0.80). Its best performance was in patients 65 to 74 years (c-statistic 0.84), and its worst in patients >/=85 years (c-statistic 0.71). POTTER had the best discrimination for predicting septic shock (c-statistic 0.90), respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation for >/=48 hours (c-statistic 0.86), and acute renal failure (c-statistic 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: POTTER is a novel, interpretable, and highly accurate predictor of in-hospital mortality in elderly ES patients up to age 85 years. POTTER could prove useful for bedside counseling and for benchmarking of ES care.\n",

Participants were between 3 and 12 years of age. Diagnoses were autistic disorder (n  =  26, 55%) and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (n  =  21, 45%). Analysis showed that the full sample received significantly higher scores on the Leiter-R than SB5 (mean discrepancy of 20.91 points), specific diagnosis was not a significant factor, and younger children had a larger discrepancy between tests. These analyses strongly suggest that the Leiter-R and the SB5 may not be equivalent measures of intellectual functioning in children with autism spectrum disorders, and that use of one or the other exclusively could lead to misclassification of intellectual capacity.\n",

Despite \"normal\" IQ reported in a majority of patients, the rates of learning disabilities and severe outcome (ranging from 0% to 20%) are not clearly established. METHODS: A large population-based series was investigated based on a longitudinal follow-up until school age, using Wechsler Intelligence scales at 3, 5, and 7 years. RESULTS: Fifty women were referred to a tertiary referral unit for an \"apparently\" isolated ACC confirmed by ultrasound, foetal MRI, and karyotyping or array CGH. Twelve pregnancies were terminated, one foetus died in utero, one pregnancy outcome was unknown, and 36 babies were born. Two were lost to follow-up. Thirty-four children could be classified into three groups. Group 1 comprised two children (6%) with severe intellectual disability (one Mowat-Wilson syndrome and one ASD). Group 2 comprised 10 children (29%) who had learning disabilities and borderline intellectual functioning (VIQ and/or PIQ scores >70 and <85); three patients had hypopituitarism with additional MRI anomalies revealed after birth. Group 3 comprised 22 children (65%) who had both VIQ and PIQ >85 (-1 SD) with a normal school level. Longitudinal follow-up revealed weaker PIQ in younger children which improved with age. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that intellectual ability is normal (IQ > 85) in approximately two thirds and borderline in just over a quarter of patients. However, a low risk of severe cognitive impairment exists, and this information should be shared with couples during prenatal counselling.\n",

This study explores the early predictive value of a widely used developmental measure for intellectual functioning during early childhood to better inform whether there is value added in continued monitoring. METHODS: Participants were 209 children who had at least two assessments between the ages of 1 and 6 years old as part of NICU Follow-Up clinic. The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III) was administered when children were 1 and 2 years old and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV) was administered when children were 3 years and older. RESULTS: The Bayley-III at 1 year of age was a significant predictor of Bayley-III performance at age 2. Similarly, Bayley-III at ages 1 year and 2 years were significant predictors of WPPSI-IV performance. Strength of prediction was moderate with the majority of variance unexplained. Exploratory analyses examining whether early developmental abilities as assessed on the Bayley-III could identify patients at risk for poorer WPPSI-IV performance indicated appropriate specificity but inadequate sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports ongoing assessment of children who were born with perinatal complications into at least early childhood. Assessing development only during the infant and toddler years did not sufficiently identify children who went on to have lower cognitive functioning in preschool and the early school years.\n",

Median follow up was 61 months (range 1-144 months). Tumor location was suprasellar (n = 9), bifocal (8), pineal (6), and basal ganglia (1). Three children showed dissemination on imaging. 2/24 had only elevated serum human chorionic gonadotropin, 3/24 only elevated lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hCG, and 2/24 had both elevated serum and lumbar CSF hCG. 23/24 children completed treatment and received multi-agent chemotherapy followed by either ventricular radiation (2340-2400 cGy) (n = 9), ventricular radiation + boost (1600 cGy) (n = 8), whole brain (2340 cGy) (n = 3), focal (4000 cGy) (n = 2) or craniospinal radiation (2340 cGy) (n = 1). Five-year progression free and overall survival was 96 and 100 % respectively. 8/24 patients with ventricular radiation +/- boost (2340/4000 cGy) displayed stable full scale intelligence quotient over a mean interval of 3 years following radiation, but showed declined processing speed.

Research on the effect of OSA on cognitive functioning following stroke is scarce. The primary objective of this study was to compare stroke patients with and without OSA on cognitive and functional status upon admission to inpatient rehabilitation. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING AND PATIENTS: 147 stroke patients admitted to a neurorehabilitation unit. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS: All patients underwent sleep examination for diagnosis of OSA. We assessed cognitive status by neuropsychological examination and functional status by two neurological scales and a measure of functional independence. RESULTS: We included 80 stroke patients with OSA and 67 stroke patients without OSA. OSA patients were older and had a higher body mass index than patients without OSA. OSA patients performed worse on tests of attention, executive functioning, visuoperception, psychomotor ability, and intelligence than those without OSA. No differences were found for vigilance, memory, and language. OSA patients had a worse neurological status, lower functional independence scores, and a longer period of hospitalization in the neurorehabilitation unit than the patients without OSA. OSA status was not associated with stroke type or classification. CONCLUSIONS: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with a lower cognitive and functional status in patients admitted for stroke rehabilitation. This underlines the importance of OSA as a probable prognostic factor, and calls for well-designed randomized controlled trials to study its treatability.\n",

INTERVENTIONS: Audiologic characteristics measured included side and severity of hearing loss and word recognition scores in quiet and in noise. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive abilities were measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; reading, math, and writing achievement was measured with the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test - Second Edition - Abbreviated; and oral language skills were measured with the Oral Written and Language Scales. RESULTS: Children with unilateral hearing loss had worse verbal cognitive and oral language scores than children with normal hearing, but there were no differences in achievement scores. Children with profound unilateral hearing loss tended to have worse cognitive scores and had significantly lower oral language scores. Higher word recognition scores of the normal hearing ear in quiet were associated with higher cognitive, oral language, and reading achievement scores. Higher word recognition scores in noise were slightly correlated with higher oral language scores. CONCLUSION: As expected, children with unilateral hearing loss had worse language scores than their siblings with normal hearing, with trends toward worse cognitive scores. Children with profound unilateral hearing loss tended to have worse outcomes than children with normal hearing or less severe unilateral loss.

Inpatient-hospital falls have been identified as one of the most common medical complications after stroke, negatively influencing recovery, nevertheless, the role of cognition in relation to falls during inpatient rehabilitation is largely unexplored. Objective. We aim to predict inpatient falls in a subacute stroke rehabilitation setting using previously reported variables such as stroke severity, gender, age, ataxia, hemiparesis, and functionality in activities of daily living, further extending them with specific cognition variables assessing memory, verbal fluency, attention, and orientation. Methods: This observational study included 158 stroke patients admitted to a rehabilitation center between 2007 and 2019, with less than 30 days since stroke onset to admission. Stroke severity was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Four logistic regressions were performed including NIHSS, age, sex, ataxia, and hemiparesis plus one of the following: (1) Functional Independence Measure cognitive (C-FIM) and motor (M-FIM) subtests. (2) individual C-FIM items, (3) Ray Auditory Verbal Memory Test (RAVLT) and (4) verbal fluency test (PMR), Digit Span from Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS III), and Orientation from Test Barcelona. Results: Neither NIHSS, age, sex, ataxia nor hemiparesis predicted falls. C-FIM was a significant predictor (AUC:0.891), but not M-FIM. The problem solving C-FIM item (AUC:0.836), the RAVLT learning subtest (AUC:0.879), and PMR verbal fluency (AUC:0.871) were significant predictors for each model, respectively.

            "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is associated with changes in neurocognitive performance. Recent studies in laboratory animals have provided additional support for the neurodegeneration hypothesis. However, results from animal research need to be applied to humans with caution. Moreover, several of the studies that examine MDMA users suffer from methodological shortcomings. Therefore, a prospective cohort study was designed in order to overcome these previous methodological shortcomings and to assess the relationship between the continuing use of MDMA and cognitive performance in incipient MDMA users. It was hypothesized that, depending on the amount of MDMA taken, the continued use of MDMA over a 2-year period would lead to further decreases in cognitive performance, especially in visual paired association learning tasks. Ninety-six subjects were assessed, at the second follow-up assessment: 31 of these were non-users, 55 moderate-users, and 10 heavy-users. Separate repeated measures analyses of variance were conducted for each cognitive domain, including attention and information processing speed, episodic memory, and executive functioning. Furthermore, possible confounders including age, general intelligence, cannabis use, alcohol use, use of other concomitant substances, recent medical treatment, participation in sports, level of nutrition, sleep patterns, and subjective well-being were assessed. The Repeated measures analysis of variance (rANOVA) revealed that a marginally significant change in immediate and delayed recall test performances of visual paired associates learning had taken place within the follow-up period of 2 years. No further deterioration in continuing MDMA-users was observed in the second follow-up period. No significant differences with the other neuropsychological tests were noted. It seems that MDMA use can impair visual paired associates learning in new users. However, the groups differed in their use of concomitant use of illicit drugs. Therefore, performance differences between the groups cannot completely ascribed to the use of MDMA.\n",

            "Safrole, the main compound in the essential oil of several plants of the Laurel family (Lauraceae), and its secondary product piperonylmethylketone are the predominantly used precursors for the illicit synthesis of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) which is, in turn, the most common active ingredient in Ecstasy tablets. Analytical methods with adequate capacity to identify links and origin of precursors, such as safrole, provide valuable information for drug-related police intelligence. Authentic sassafras oil samples from police seizures were subjected to comparative analysis based on their chemical profiles obtained by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS). The enhanced separation power and increased sensitivity of GC x GC allowed for the detection of minor compounds present in the essential oils which were of particular interest in case of very pure samples whose impurity profiles were not very pronounced. Discrimination of such samples was still possible even in the absence of characteristic main compounds.\n",

            "The shape of the EEG spectrum in sleep relies on genetic and anatomical factors and forms an individual \"EEG fingerprint\". Spectral components of EEG were shown to be connected to mental ability both in sleep and wakefulness. EEG sleep spindle correlates of intelligence, however, exhibit a sexual dimorphism, with a more pronounced association to intelligence in females than males. In a sample of 151 healthy individuals, we investigated how intelligence is related to spectral components of full-night sleep EEG, while controlling for the effects of age. A positive linear association between intelligence and REM anterior beta power was found in females but not males. Transient, spindle-like \"REM beta tufts\" are described in the EEG of healthy subjects, which may reflect the functioning of a recently described cingular-prefrontal emotion and motor regulation network. REM sleep frontal high delta power was a negative correlate of intelligence. NREM alpha and sigma spectral power correlations with intelligence did not unequivocally remain significant after multiple comparisons correction, but exhibited a similar sexual dimorphism. These results suggest that the neural oscillatory correlates of intelligence in sleep are sexually dimorphic, and they are not restricted to either sleep spindles or NREM sleep.\n",

            "Purpose: Explainability and fairness are two key factors for the effective and ethical clinical implementation of deep learning-based machine learning models in healthcare settings. However, there has been limited work on investigating how unfair performance manifests in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods, and how XAI can be used to investigate potential reasons for unfairness. Thus, the aim of this work was to analyze the effects of previously established sociodemographic-related confounders on classifier performance and explainability methods. Approach: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to predict biological sex from T1-weighted brain MRI datasets of 4547 9- to 10-year-old adolescents from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. Performance disparities of the trained CNN between White and Black subjects were analyzed and saliency maps were generated for each subgroup at the intersection of sex and race. Results: The classification model demonstrated a significant difference in the percentage of correctly classified White male ( 90.3% +/- 1.7% ) and Black male ( 81.1% +/- 4.5% ) children. Conversely, slightly higher performance was found for Black female ( 89.3% +/- 4.8% ) compared with White female ( 86.5% +/- 2.0% ) children. Saliency maps showed subgroup-specific differences, corresponding to brain regions previously associated with pubertal development. In line with this finding, average pubertal development scores of subjects used in this study were significantly different between Black and White females ( p < 0.001 ) and males ( p < 0.001 ). Conclusions: We demonstrate that a CNN with significantly different sex classification performance between Black and White adolescents can identify different important brain regions when comparing subgroup saliency maps. Importance scores vary substantially between subgroups within brain structures associated with pubertal development, a race-associated confounder for predicting sex. We illustrate that unfair models can produce different XAI results between subgroups and that these results may explain potential reasons for biased performance.\n",

This is, to a lesser degree, also found in first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients. It is unclear whether bipolar disorder I (BD-I) patients and their relatives have similar lower intellectual and educational performance as that observed in schizophrenia. METHOD: This cross-sectional study investigated intelligence and educational performance in two outpatient samples [494 BD-I patients, 952 schizophrenia spectrum (SCZ) patients], 2231 relatives of BD-I and SCZ patients, 1104 healthy controls and 100 control siblings. Mixed-effects and regression models were used to compare groups on intelligence and educational performance. RESULTS: BD-I patients were more likely to have completed the highest level of education (odds ratio 1.88, 95% confidence interval 1.66-2.70) despite having a lower IQ compared to controls (beta = -9.09, S.E. = 1.27, p < 0.001). In contrast, SCZ patients showed both a lower IQ (beta = -15.31, S.E. = 0.86, p < 0.001) and lower educational levels compared to controls. Siblings of both patient groups had significantly lower IQ than control siblings, but did not differ on educational performance. IQ scores did not differ between BD-I parents and SCZ parents, but BD-I parents had completed higher educational levels. CONCLUSIONS: Although BD-I patients had a lower IQ than controls, they were more likely to have completed the highest level of education. This contrasts with SCZ patients, who showed both intellectual and educational deficits compared to healthy controls. Since relatives of BD-I patients did not demonstrate superior educational performance, our data suggest that high educational performance may be a distinctive feature of bipolar disorder patients.\n",

First-degree relatives of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD-FDRs) show divergent patterns; on average, intracranial volume is larger compared to controls, and findings on cognitive alterations in BD-FDRs are inconsistent. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of global and regional brain measures (cortical and subcortical), current IQ, and educational attainment in 5,795 individuals (1,103 SZ-FDRs, 867 BD-FDRs, 2,190 controls, 942 schizophrenia patients, 693 bipolar patients) from 36 schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder family cohorts, with standardized methods. Compared to controls, SZ-FDRs showed a pattern of widespread thinner cortex, while BD-FDRs had widespread larger cortical surface area. IQ was lower in SZ-FDRs (d = -0.42, p = 3 x 10(-5) ), with weak evidence of IQ reductions among BD-FDRs (d = -0.23, p = .045). Both relative groups had similar educational attainment compared to controls. When adjusting for IQ or educational attainment, the group-effects on brain measures changed, albeit modestly. Changes were in the expected direction, with less pronounced brain abnormalities in SZ-FDRs and more pronounced effects in BD-FDRs. To conclude, SZ-FDRs and BD-FDRs show a differential pattern of structural brain abnormalities. In contrast, both had lower IQ scores and similar school achievements compared to controls. Given that brain differences between SZ-FDRs and BD-FDRs remain after adjusting for IQ or educational attainment, we suggest that differential brain developmental processes underlying predisposition for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder are likely independent of general cognitive impairment.\n",

The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of mental disorder and levels of cognitive and social functioning in individuals who have children by partners with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder compared to controls. The Danish High Risk and Resilience Study VIA 7 is a population-based cohort study conducted in Denmark between 2013 and 2016. This study focus on parents diagnosed with schizophrenia (n = 150) or bipolar disorder (n = 100) and control parents (n = 182), as well as their partners without schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (n = 440). We used linear mixed-effect models, and main outcomes were mental disorders, intelligence, processing speed, verbal working memory, and social functioning. We found that parents having children by a partner with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder more often fulfilled the criteria for a mental disorder and had poorer social functioning compared to parents having children by a partner without schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Furthermore, parents having children by a partner with schizophrenia performed poorer on processing speed compared to parents in the control group. The presence of nonrandom mating found in this study has implications for our understanding of familial transmission of these disorders and our findings should be considered in future investigations of potential risk factors for children with a parent with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.\n",

            "Cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of schizophrenia and is also present in bipolar disorder (BD). Whereas decreased intelligence precedes the onset of psychosis in schizophrenia and remains relatively stable thereafter; high intelligence is a risk factor for bipolar illness but cognitive function decreases after onset of symptoms. While in schizophrenia, many studies have been conducted on the development of cognitive enhancing agents; in BD such studies are almost non-existent. This review focuses on the pharmacological agents with putative effects on cognition in both schizophrenia and bipolar illness; specifically agents targeting the dopaminergic, cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter pathways in schizophrenia and the cognitive effects of lithium, anticonvulsants and antipsychotics in BD. In the final analysis we conclude that cognitive enhancing agents have not yet been produced convincingly for schizophrenia and have hardly been studied in BD. Importantly, studies should focus on other phases of the illness. To be able to treat cognitive deficits effectively in schizophrenia, patients in the very early stages of the illness, or even before - in the ultra-high risk stages - should be targeted. In contrast, cognitive deficits occur later in BD, and therefore drugs should be tested in BD after the onset of illness. Hopefully, we will then find effective drugs for the incapacitating effects of cognitive deficits in these patients.\n",

            "Apart from motor and behavioral dysfunctions, deficits in cognitive skills are among the well-documented sequelae of preterm birth. However, early identification of infants at risk for poor cognition is still a challenge, as no clear association between pathological findings based on neuroimaging scans and cognitive functions have been detected as yet. The Prechtl General Movement Assessment (GMA) has shown its merits for the evaluation of the integrity of the young nervous system. It is a reliable tool for identifying infants at risk for neuromotor deficits. Recent studies on preterm infants demonstrate that abnormal general movements (GMs) also reflect impairments of brain areas involved in cognitive development. The aim of this systematic review was to discuss studies that included (i) the Prechtl GMA applied in preterm infants, and (ii) cognitive outcome measures in six data bases. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria and yielded the following results: (a) children born preterm with consistently abnormal GMs up to 8 weeks after term had lower intelligence quotients at school age than children with an early normalization of GMs; (b) from 3 to 5 months after term, several qualitative, and quantitative aspects of the concurrent motor repertoire, including postural patterns, were predictive of intelligence at 7-10 years of age. These findings in 428 individuals born preterm suggest that normal GMs along with a normal motor repertoire during the first months after term are markers for normal cognitive development until at least age 10.\n",

As early motor performance may be essential for developing later visual-perceptual and visual-motor skills, early motor performance may be associated with PIQ. AIMS: To evaluate whether in preterm born children motor performance at two years was associated with PIQ at eight years. METHODS: Single-centre cohort study including 88 children born <30 weeks' gestation between 2007 and 2011, who completed the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III (BSID-III) at two years and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III-NL (WISC-III-NL) at eight years. Outcome measurements (mean (SD)) were gross and fine motor performance based on the BSID-III, and PIQ and VIQ based on the WISC-III-NL. Linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between motor performance at two years and PIQ at eight years. RESULTS: At two years, mean BSID-III gross motor scaled score was 9.0 (SD 3.0) and fine motor score was 11.5 (SD 2.3). At eight years, mean PIQ was 94.9 (SD 13.5) and mean VIQ 101.8 (SD 13.7). A one-point increase in fine motor scaled score was associated with 1.7 points (95% CI 0.5-2.8) increase in PIQ. Gross motor scaled score was not associated with PIQ. CONCLUSIONS: Fine motor performance in toddlerhood was related to PIQ at school age, with lower scores indicating a lower PIQ. Early assessment of fine motor performance may be beneficial in identifying children at risk for lower performance intelligence.\n",

METHODS: Three-dimensional (3D) kinematic recordings of arm and head movements during a unimanual precision task were related to performance on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition, in a sample of 32 children born preterm (gestational age, mean: 31.5 weeks [range: 22-35 weeks]; birth weight, mean: 1699 g [range: 404-2962 g]) at 6 years to 8 years with no diagnosed cognitive, sensory, or motor impairments compared with 40 age-matched control children born fullterm. RESULTS: In the children born preterm, upper-limb movement duration and segmentation of movement trajectories were significantly associated with full-scale intelligence quotient independent of gestational age (GA) and sex. These effects pertained to the preferred side, characterized by more effective movement organization being linked with increased intelligence scores. The same relations were not seen in the controls. Within the children born preterm, a significant effect of GA was also found for some aspects of upper-limb movement organization. Full-scale intelligence quotient was within normal limits for both groups but significantly lower in the preterm (mean: 94.5 [range: 72-120]) compared with the fullterm (mean: 101.7 [range: 76-119]) born children.

Although there are increasing numbers of reports on outcomes from international cohorts of premature infants, a Swiss national report on infants after 2 years of age is lacking. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To describe neurodevelopmental outcomes at early school age of preterm children born in Switzerland with a special focus on the cognitive abilities. METHODS: This prospective national cohort study included children born alive before 30 weeks of gestation in 2006. At 5 years of age, children underwent a neurological examination and intelligence testing with the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children first edition (K-ABC). We assessed the mental processing composite score (MPC) and its subscales to explore specific cognitive deficits. The primary outcome was cognitive impairment (MPC score &lt;-1 standard deviation from the normative mean), motor impairment (cerebral palsy), or sensory impairment (any visual or hearing deficiency). The need for early intervention or therapies and the association of perinatal factors with cognitive impairment were secondary and tertiary outcomes. Logistic regression models were used to analyse associations between neonatal factors and cognitive outcome. RESULTS: Of 289 survivors, 235 were assessed. Of the 199 children with results obtained from the K-ABC, 42 (21%) showed cognitive impairment and 80 (40%) showed impairment in short-term memory. Cerebral palsy was diagnosed in 14 (6%), and visual and auditory impairment in 36 (15%) and 12 (5%) children, respectively; 63 (27%) needed early intervention or therapies. Cognitive impairment was associated with low socioeconomic status, but not with gestational age, small birthweight for gestational age, bronchodysplasia, or significant brain injury. A total of 146 children (63%) survived without any impairment. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report neurodevelopmental outcomes at early school age in a Swiss cohort. The majority had favourable outcomes, but 21% of children demonstrated cognitive impairment, which was most pronounced in short-term memory. Our findings were similar to those of international cohorts and indicate that preterm children born before 300/7 gestational weeks, especially those living in unfavourable social environments, are at an increased risk of cognitive impairment and need close monitoring beyond early school age.

The links between their ToM abilities, their level in seven self-regulation strategies as displayed in social problem-solving tasks and their social adjustment profiles (assessed by the Social Competence and Behavior Evaluation, completed by their teachers) were examined. Children with EB presented lower comprehension of causes of emotions and lower self-regulation of joint attention and of attention than children with ID and TD children. In comparison with TD children, lower social adjustment was observed in nearly all dimensions of profiles in both atypical groups. Specifically, children with EB were significantly angrier than children with ID. Although variable patterns of positive correlations were obtained in atypical groups between self-regulation strategies and ToM abilities, the most numerous positive links were obtained in the group with EB. Regression analyses showed that developmental age predicted ToM abilities and certain dimensions of social adjustment profiles in atypical groups. In the ID group, ToM emotions predicted general adaptation, affective adaptation, interactions with peers and with adults and low internalizing problems. In the EB group, general adaptation was predicted by ToM emotions and self-regulation, interactions with peers by ToM beliefs, and a low level of externalizing problems by ToM emotions.

            "BACKGROUND: Albumin, an important component of fluid balance, is associated with kidney, liver, nutritional, and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and is measured by blood tests. Since fluid balance is associated with electrocardiography (ECG) changes, we established a deep learning model (DLM) to estimate albumin via ECG. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a DLM to estimate albumin via ECG and explored its contribution to future complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A DLM was trained for estimating ECG-based albumin (ECG-Alb) using 155,078 ECGs corresponding to albumin from 79,111 patients, and another independent 13,335 patients from an academic medical center and 11,370 patients from a community hospital were used for internal and external validation. The primary analysis focused on distinguishing patients with mild to severe hypoalbuminemia, and the secondary analysis aimed to provide additional prognostic value from ECG-Alb for future complications, which included mortality, new-onset hypoalbuminemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), new onset hepatitis, CVD mortality, new-onset acute myocardial infarction (AMI), new-onset stroke (STK), new-onset coronary artery disease (CAD), new-onset heart failure (HF), and new-onset atrial fibrillation (Afib). RESULTS: The AUC to identify hypoalbuminemia was 0.8771 with a sensitivity of 56.0% and a specificity of 90.7% in the internal validation set, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.69 in the continuous analysis. The most important ECG features contributing to ECG-Alb were ordered in terms of heart rate, corrected QT interval, T wave axis, sinus rhythm, P wave axis, etc. The group with severely low ECG-Alb had a higher risk of all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR): 2.45, 95% CI: 1.81-3.33] and the other hepatorenal and cardiovascular events in the internal validation set. The external validation set yielded similar results. CONCLUSION: Hypoalbuminemia and its complications can be predicted using ECG-Alb as a novel biomarker, which may be a non-invasive tool to warn asymptomatic patients.\n",

            "Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) has become a cornerstone in the diagnostic process of the heart disease. Although the cardiac imaging with interventional procedures is responsible for approximately 40% of the cumulative effective dose in medical imaging, a relevant radiation dose reduction over the last decade was obtained, with the beginning of the sub-mSv era in CTCA. The main technical basis to obtain a radiation dose reduction in CTCA is the use of a low tube voltage, the adoption of a prospective electrocardiogram-triggering spiral protocol and the application of the tube current modulation with the iterative reconstruction technique. Nevertheless, CTCA examinations are characterized by a wide range of radiation doses between different radiology departments. Moreover, the dose exposure in CTCA is extremely important because the benefit-risk calculus in comparison with other modalities also depends on it. Finally, because anatomical evaluation not adequately predicts the hemodynamic relevance of coronary stenosis, a low radiation dose in routine CTCA would allow the greatest use of the myocardial CT perfusion, fractional flow reserve-CT, dual-energy CT and artificial intelligence, to shift focus from morphological assessment to a comprehensive morphological and functional evaluation of the stenosis. Therefore, the aim of this work is to summarize the correct use of the technical basis in order that CTCA becomes an established examination for assessment of the coronary artery disease with low radiation dose.\n",

            "The aim of this study was to specify whether cerebellar lesions cause visuospatial impairments in children. The study sample consisted of 40 children with low-grade cerebellar astrocytoma, who underwent surgical treatment and 40 healthy controls matched with regard to age and sex. Visuospatial abilities were tested using the spatial WISC-R subtests (Block Design and Object Assembly), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, Benton Judgment of Line Orientation Test, PEBL Mental Rotation Task, and Benton Visual Retention Test. To exclude general diffuse intellectual dysfunction, the WISC-R Verbal Intelligence IQ, Performance IQ, and Full-Scale IQ scores were analysed. Post-surgical medical consequences were measured with the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale. Compared to controls, the cerebellar group manifested problems with mental rotation of objects, visuospatial organization, planning, and spatial construction processes which could not be explained by medical complications or general intellectual retardation. The intensity of visuospatial syndrome highly depends on cerebellar lesion side. Patients with left-sided cerebellar lesions display more severe spatial problems than those with right-sided cerebellar lesions. In conclusion, focal cerebellar lesions in children affect their visuospatial ability. The impairments profile is characterized by deficits in complex spatial processes such as visuospatial organization and mental rotation, requiring reconstruction of visual stimuli using the imagination, while elementary sensory analysis and perception as well as spatial processes requiring direct manipulation of objects are relatively better preserved. This pattern is analogous to the one previously observed in adult population and appears to be typical for cerebellar pathology in general, regardless of age.\n",

Participants included 835 children from the China Jintan Cohort Study for the cross-sectional study and 511 children for the longitudinal study. Breakfast consumption was assessed at ages 6 and 12 through parental and self-administered questionnaires. Cognitive ability was measured as a composition of IQ at age 6 and 12 and academic achievement at age 12, which were assessed by the Chinese versions of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales and standardized school reports, respectively. Multivariable general linear and mixed models were used to evaluate the relationships between breakfast consumption, breakfast composition and cognitive performance. In the longitudinal analyses, 94.7% of participants consumed breakfast >/= 4 days per week. Controlling for nine covariates, multivariate mixed models reported that compared to infrequent breakfast consumption, regular breakfast intake was associated with an increase of 5.54 points for verbal and 4.35 points for full IQ scores (p < 0.05).

Our aims were to estimate associations of adult-life alcohol consumption and consumption patterns with age-related cognitive decline. METHODS: We investigated the associations of self-reported adult-life weekly alcohol consumption and weekly extreme binge drinking (>/=10 units on the same occasion) with changes in test scores on an identical validated test of intelligence completed in early adulthood and late midlife in 2498 Danish men from the Lifestyle and Cognition Follow-up study 2015. Analyses were adjusted for year of birth, retest interval, baseline IQ, education and smoking. RESULTS: Men with adult-life alcohol consumption of more than 28 units/week had a larger decline in IQ scores from early adulthood to late midlife than men consuming 1-14 units/week (B29-35units/week = -3.6; P < 0.001). Likewise, a 1-year increase in weekly extreme binge drinking was associated with a 0.12-point decline in IQ scores (P < 0.001). Weekly extreme binge drinking explained more variance in IQ changes than average weekly consumption. In analyses including mutual adjustment of weekly extreme binge drinking and average weekly alcohol consumption, the estimated IQ decline associated with extreme binge drinking was largely unaffected, whereas the association with weekly alcohol consumption became non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: Adult-life heavy alcohol consumption and extreme binge drinking appear to be associated with larger cognitive decline in men. Moreover, extreme binge drinking may be more important than weekly alcohol consumption in relation to cognitive decline.\n",

This study aims to develop demographically calibrated norms for these premorbid measures in a representative sample of the adult Spanish population in terms of age, education, and sex. A sample of 700 healthy participants from 18 to 86 years old completed the WAT and the PW Reading subtest. The effect of age, years of formal education, and sex on WAT total score, PW total score, and time to complete the PW task (PW time) were analyzed. Percentiles and scalar scores were obtained for each raw score according to nine age ranges and individual education levels. The results indicated a significant effect of age and education on the premorbid performance assessed, with no significant effect of sex. Age and education explained from 1.9 to 33.2% of the variance in premorbid IQ variables. Older participants with fewer years of education obtained worse premorbid IQ estimates. This premorbid IQ estimation decline started in the 56-65 age range for WAT total score and PW time, whereas it started in the 71-75 age range for PW total score. This study reports the first demographic-calibrated norms for WAT and PW Reading subtest for Spanish-speaking population. Even though the influence of age and years of education on premorbid IQ measures was confirmed, the PW Reading subtest showed to be more resistant to decline in elderly population than the WAT.\n",

            "OBJECTIVE: Two frequently used measures to assess premorbid intellectual ability include the Wide Range Achievement Test, 4th Edition Reading Subtest (WRAT-4 READ) and the Test of Premorbid Functioning (TOPF). The present study compared estimates obtained from these measures in a neurodegenerative disease population. METHOD: Records from 85 referrals seen for neuropsychological evaluation in a neurodegenerative disorders clinic were reviewed. Evaluations included TOPF, WRAT-4 READ, and measures of memory, reasoning, language, and executive functioning. Pairwise correlations and concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) were calculated between raw scores and predicted intelligence estimates. Discrepancy scores were calculated between estimates and data were divided into three groups based on size of standardized discrepancy score: Equal, WRAT-4 READ > TOPF, and TOPF > WRAT-4 READ. analysis of variances compared groups on demographic characteristics and cognitive performance. RESULTS: Despite strong Pearson correlation, CCC between predicted IQ estimates showed poor agreement between measures, with evidence of both fixed and proportional bias. Discrepancies ranged from -24.0 to 22.0 (M = 1.78, SD = 6.65), with TOPF generating higher estimates on average. Individuals performing better on WRAT-4 READ were significantly older (M age = 76.26, SD = 7.53) than those performing similarly on both measures and those performing better on TOPF (F (2, 82) = 7.31, p < .001). All other comparisons between groups on demographic variables and cognitive measures were non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of premorbid intelligence obtained from the TOPF and WRAT-4 READ have a strong linear relationship, but systematically generate inconsistent estimates in a neurodegenerative disease clinical sample and should not be used interchangeably.\n",

The test measures failures of selective attention to face parts through congruency effects, an operational definition of holistic processing. However, this conception of holistic processing has been challenged by the suggestion that it may tap into the same selective attention or cognitive control mechanisms that yield congruency effects in Stroop and Flanker paradigms. Here, we report data from 130 subjects on the VHPT-F, several versions of Stroop and Flanker tasks, as well as fluid IQ. Results suggested a small degree of shared variance in Stroop and Flanker congruency effects, which did not relate to congruency effects on the VHPT-F. Variability on the VHPT-F was also not correlated with Fluid IQ. In sum, we find no evidence that holistic face processing as measured by congruency in the VHPT-F is accounted for by domain-general control mechanisms.\n",

METHOD: Semantic fluency, verbal and visual memory, and executive functions were assessed in 39 PD and 162 HC. A linear regression model was used to analyze the discrepancies between the predicted cognitive performance and the current raw scores through PI variables (Word Accentuation Test (WAT), Pseudo-Words (PW) Reading subtest from PROLEC-R, age, and years of education). ROC analyses were performed to assess their diagnostic properties. RESULTS: Significant differences were found in the raw cognitive scores between patients and HC [semantic fluency (t = 6.07; p < 0.001), verbal memory (t = 6.63; p < 0.001), and executive functions (t = 2.57; p = 0.013), and in visual memory (t = 1.97; p = 0.055 marginally significant)]. Compared to HC, PD patients presented higher discrepancies between the predicted cognitive performance and the raw scores in semantic fluency, verbal memory, visual memory, executive functions (AUC = 0.78, 0.78; 0.64, 0.61, respectively). CONCLUSION: The magnitude of the discrepancies scores between the current and the predicted cognitive performance based on PI indicates the presence of cognitive decline in the specific cognitive domain in PD patients.

Besides the visible motor impairments, cognitive abilities are frequently affected but might remain unrecognised in children with mild forms. On the other hand, some severely disabled children with presumed intellectual disabilities might demonstrate normal-range reasoning capacities. Most studies on this topic have emphasized a variety of cognitive profiles (cognitive level) related to the type of cerebral palsy and the underlying brain lesions (biological level). However, little is known at the behavioural level, namely learning skills and educational achievement. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review aimed to discuss cognitive and scholastic skills typically affected in children with CP. METHODS: Online literature research for studies of cerebral palsy, cognition and academic achievement, extracting all relevant articles regardless of article type. RESULTS: In children with CP, intellectual disability is frequent and correlated with the degree of motor impairment and early epilepsy. Speech and language problems are prevalent in all forms of CP and might hamper everyday participation on varying levels depending on the degree of motor disability. Most children with CP have neuropsychological deficits affecting predominantly visuospatial functions, attention, and/or executive functions. These problems relate to academic performance and social participation. DISCUSSION: An adequate interdisciplinary follow-up of children with CP requires a sensitization of clinicians to the complex topic of cognitive and academic problems in this population and a better synergy between the medical and educational worlds.\n",

To assess a comprehensive range of cognitive functions using psychometric measures with established normative, reliability, and validity data. METHODS: A group of 71 adults was assessed at approximately five years (mean = 66 months) following injury. Assessment of cognitive functioning covered the domains of intelligence, attention, verbal and visual memory, visual-spatial construction, and executive functions. RESULTS: Impairment was evident across all domains but prevalence varied both within and between domains. Across aspects of intelligence clinical impairment ranged from 8-25% , attention 39-62% , verbal memory 16-46% , visual memory 23-51% , visual-spatial construction 38% , and executive functions (verbal fluency) 13% . In addition, 3-23% of performances across the measures were in the borderline range, suggesting a high prevalence of subclinical deficit. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of impairment may vary across cognitive domains, long-term follow-up documented deficits in all six domains. These findings provide further evidence that while improvement of cognitive functioning following significant traumatic brain injury may be possible, recovery of function is unlikely.\n",

Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been reported to improve the cognitive function in patients with cognitive impairment. However, whether CAS can ameliorate the cognitive impairment in patients with LA remains unknown. To address this problem, we prospectively enrolled 105 LA patients with carotid stenosis and 206 healthy subjects, who are free of carotid artery stenosis and brain diseases or injuries, as the control. Neuropsychological functions were tested in these LA patients before and after 1-, 6- and 12-month CAS, and compared with the data of control subjects. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised China (WAIS-RC) scores were lower in LA patients than those in healthy controls (P < 0.05), indicating the cognitive impairment in the LA patients. Compared with the scores before CAS, there is a time-dependent increase in MMSE and WAIS-RC scores after 1-, 6- and 12-month CAS (P < 0.05). Moreover, CAS treatment reduced Clinical Dementia Rating scale in LA patients. The cognitive impairment of LA patients with carotid stenosis was severe, but their cognitive impairment was ameliorated with carotid stenosis (P < 0.01).

            "Professionalism is a fundamental expectation of practicing medicine and a core competency in medical education, yet the methods of how to teach and evaluate it are still experimental. Professionalism involves self-reflection, a psychodynamic understanding of the patient's and the doctor's predicament, and conflict resolution, so psychiatrists are uniquely qualified to teach it. This article describes an innovative course that utilizes psychodynamic principles to teach professionalism to medical students. The authors present a novel 2-year curriculum for teaching professionalism to first- and second-year medical students utilizing psychodynamic principles to help develop awareness of others' feelings and motivations, self-reflection, compassion, empathy, and skills in ethical conflict resolution by means of written and oral narrative exercises. Outcomes are evaluated by the student ratings about the course and the faculty, and by using the test for emotional intelligence (EI), administered as a baseline and then at the end of each year. Each subsequent year the students demonstrated a statistically significant increase in EI scores, student evaluations of the course ranked among the highest in the medical school, clerkship supervisors and residency training directors noted the high degree of professionalism of the students, and the number of student applicants to psychiatry residency were consistently higher than the national average. In addition, this course was awarded the 2018 Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society's Edward B. Harris Medical Professionalism Award for the best professionalism course of U.S. medical schools. Psychodynamic principles are fundamental for teaching medical professionalism at a medical-student level. Professionalism also serves as a way to introduce students to psychiatry early in the curriculum, and psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are uniquely qualified to teach medical professionalism.\n",

We first focus on Horn's methodological demonstrations describing (a) the many uses of simulated random variables in exploratory factor analysis; (b) the exploratory uses of confirmatory factor analysis; and (c) the key differences between states, traits, and trait-changes. On a substantive basis, John believed that there were important individual differences among people in terms of cognition and personality. These sentiments led to his intellectual battles about (d) Spearman's g theory of a unitary intelligence, (e) Guilford's multifaceted model of intelligence, and (f) the Schaie and Baltes approach to defining the lack of decline of intelligence earlier in the life span.

FRAMEWORK: Senior citizens attending senior universities and from the community in the district of Viseu. PARTICIPANTS: 1084 subjects participated with a mean age of 72.98 years, residing in the district of Viseu, no longer involved in formal activities (retired) and participating voluntarily in study. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: the Emotional Intelligence Measuring (MIE) Scale, socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status, residence). An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the MIE scale were performed. RESULTS: The MIE showed very good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.952). The main component and rotation factor analysis varimax extracted 36 items and five factors which explain 54.78% of the total variance. After confirmatory factor analysis and re-specification of the model, the global indicator values of the adjustment model for the MIE revealed a quality of good fit (X(2)/df=3.46; RMR=0.025). The final version of the MIE was composed of 33 items and five factors that represent emotional intelligence skills: Factor 1 - Empathy (12 items); Factor 2 - Self-motivation (10 items); Factor 3 - Self-awareness (4 items); Factor 4 - Self-control (4 items); Factor 5 - Sociability (3 items). CONCLUSION: The MIE scale is shown to be suitable to assess emotional intelligence in Portuguese senior citizens.\n",

We identified 17 studies comparing the intelligence, executive functions, verbal memory and attention of 447 patients with DSM-IV MDD and 1,347 healthy children and adolescents. Children and adolescents with MDD performed 0.194-0.772 (p < 0.001) standard mean differences worse than healthy control subjects in neuropsychological test procedures. The most pronounced deficits of children and adolescents with MDD were seen in inhibition capacity (STD = 0.772; p = 0.002), phonemic verbal fluency (STD = 0.756; p = 0.0001), sustained attention (STD = 0.522; p = 0.000), verbal memory (STD = 0.516; p = 0.0009) and planning (STD = 0.513; p = 0.014).

            "INTRODUCTION: To further investigate manifestations of episodic memory impairments in adolescents, we examined the role of encoding on recognition of stimuli in conditions designed to emphasize their item-specific versus relational characteristics in a group of 12-18 year olds with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We also examined how strategic learning and memory processes, verbal abilities, attention, and age were associated with recognition in this group. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Twenty two high functioning adolescents with ASD (mean age=15 years; SD=1.8; range=12.2-17.9), and 26 age, gender, and IQ-matched adolescents with typical development (TYP) (mean age=14.7 years; SD=1.9; range=12.3-17.8) completed the Relational and Item-Specific Encoding task (RiSE), the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C), the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence, and the Connors' Parent Rating Scale-Revised. Univariate statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: The ASD group showed poorer performance on strategic memory assessed by the CVLT-C. Surprisingly, on the RiSE, ASD showed poorer discriminability for objects encoded in item-specific versus relational encoding conditions and were more impaired in familiarity (after relational encoding) than in recollection. ASD also did not show the hypothesized association between item and associative recognition and CVLT-C performance found in TYP. Instead, in the ASD group recognition was associated with increased age. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the RiSE task demonstrated that adolescents with ASD do not always exhibit impaired memory for relational information as commonly believed. Instead, memory was worse when cognitive control demands were high, when encoding focused on specific item features, and when familiarity was used to retrieve relational information. Recognition also was better in older participants. This suggests that learning and memory deficits in adolescents with ASD, may not be due primarily to failed relational binding processes in the hippocampus but, rather to disrupted strategic memory and familiarity processes associated with the prefrontal and perirhinal cortices. These findings demonstrate the importance and utility of using well-validated cognitive neuroscience tasks and of considering the ages of participants when comparing the neural underpinnings of different memory processes in both typical and atypical populations.\n",

            "Objective: It is commonly thought that memory deficits in frontal patients are a result of impairments in executive functions which impact upon storage and retrieval processes. Yet, few studies have specifically examined the relationship between memory performance and executive functions in frontal patients. Furthermore, the contribution of more general cognitive processes such as fluid intelligence and demographic factors such as age, education, and premorbid intelligence has not been considered. Method: Our study examined the relationship between recall and recognition memory and performance on measures of fluid intelligence, executive functions and premorbid intelligence in 39 frontal patients and 46 healthy controls. Results: Recall memory impairments in frontal patients were strongly correlated with fluid intelligence, executive functions and premorbid intelligence. These factors were all found to be independent predictors of recall performance, with fluid intelligence being the strongest predictor. In contrast, recognition memory impairments were not related to any of these factors. Furthermore, age and education were not significantly correlated with either recall or recognition memory measures. Conclusion: Our findings show that recall memory in frontal patients was related to fluid intelligence, executive functions and premorbid intelligence. In contrast, recognition memory was not. These findings suggest that recall and recognition memory deficits following frontal injury arise from separable cognitive factors. Recognition memory tests may be more useful when assessing memory functions in frontal patients.\n",

The main questions addressed by this study were (1) Does auditory deprivation result in global or domain-specific deficits in working memory in children with CIs compared with their NH age mates? (2) Does the potential for verbal recoding affect performance on measures of reasoning ability in children with CIs relative to their NH age mates? and (3) Is performance on verbal and visuospatial working memory tasks related to spoken receptive language level achieved by children with CIs? DESIGN: A total of 54 children ranging in age from 5 to 9 years participated; 25 children with CIs and 29 children with NH. Participants were tested on both simple and complex measures of verbal and visuospatial working memory. Vocabulary was assessed with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) and reasoning abilities with two subtests of the WISC-IV (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition): Picture Concepts (verbally mediated) and Matrix Reasoning (visuospatial task). Groups were compared on all measures using analysis of variance after controlling for age and maternal education. RESULTS: Children with CIs scored significantly lower than children with NH on measures of working memory, after accounting for age and maternal education. Differences between the groups were more apparent for verbal working memory compared with visuospatial working memory. For reasoning and vocabulary, the CI group scored significantly lower than the NH group for PPVT and WISC Picture Concepts but similar to NH age mates on WISC Matrix Reasoning. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest that children with CIs have deficits in working memory related to storing and processing verbal information in working memory. These deficits extend to receptive vocabulary and verbal reasoning and remain even after controlling for the higher maternal education level of the NH group. Their ability to store and process visuospatial information in working memory and complete reasoning tasks that minimize verbal labeling of stimuli more closely approaches performance of NH age mates.\n",

            "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Although cognitive impairment in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is primarily attributed to intermittent hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation, hypercapnia may also play a role in patients whose OSA is complicated by hypoventilation. This study investigated the impact of hypercapnia on cognitive function in severe sleep-disordered breathing (OSA accompanied by hypoventilation). METHODS: Patients with severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index >30 events/h; n = 246) underwent evaluation for accompanying hypoventilation with polysomnography that included continuous transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO(2)) monitoring and awake arterial blood gas analysis. Patients were categorized as having no hypoventilation (n = 84), isolated sleep hypoventilation (n = 40), or awake hypoventilation (n = 122). Global cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), memory with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), and processing speed with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV), Digit Symbol Coding subtest (DSC). RESULTS: Apnea-hypopnea index was similar across groups (P = .15), but the sleep and awake hypoventilation groups had greater nocturnal hypoxemia compared with the no-hypoventilation group (P < .01). Within all groups, mean MoCA scores were < 26, which is the validated threshold to indicate mild cognitive impairment; RAVLT scores were lower than age-matched norms only in the awake-hypoventilation group (P </= .01); and DSC scores were lower than age-matched norms within all groups (P < .01). In multivariable regression analyses, higher arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) and TcCO(2) during wakefulness were associated with lower MoCA and DSC scores (P </= .03), independent of confounders including overlap syndrome (OSA + chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). CONCLUSIONS: Awake hypoventilation is associated with greater deficits in cognitive function in patients with severe sleep-disordered breathing.

            "BACKGROUND: Cognitive aging is a complex phenomenon, which comprises various cognitive skills, broadly categorized into fluid and crystallized intelligence. Crystallized intelligence (gc) tends to be maintained, as opposed to fluid intelligence (gf), which tends to decline rapidly with age. The association of the two with cognitive decline remains a matter of conjecture requiring further research. AIM: The aim of the study was to identify the variables of gc and gf from a population data of Longitudinal Aging Study in India-Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (LASI-DAD) study and investigate its relationship with the onset of cognitive impairment using discrepancy analysis against neuropsychological tests. METHODS: This analysis of data from LASI-DAD study was carried out on a sample of 3,223 participants. They were assessed on extensive thirteen cognitive tests and one subjective test of cognition. Standardized score was used for discrepancy analysis. Fluid ability minus crystallized ability was used to assess the cognitive impairment. Any statistical significance with the score difference >0.99 SD was defined as a presence of cognitive decline. Hindi Mental Status Examination (HMSE) and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) were used as gold standard. RESULTS: With increased discrepancy score, each cognitive parameter score declined which was found to be statistically significant. In HMSE (Normal = 25.81 +/- 3.39; Impaired = 23.17 +/- 3.54; p = <0.001), there was a drop of 2 point scores in identifying cognitive impairment in the population sample as per the gold standard. A similar trend was evident in other neurocognitive domains as well. CONCLUSION: Crystallized-fluid intelligence discrepancy analysis has a strong potential in predicting the onset of cognitive decline ahead of time, facilitating early intervention.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: IQ deficits are linked to even mild obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in children. Although OSA is commonly first diagnosed in the pre-school age group, a randomised trial is still needed to assess IQ outcomes after adenotonsillectomy in the pre-school age-group. This randomised control trial (RCT) will primarily determine whether adenotonsillectomy improves IQ compared to no adenotonsillectomy after 12 months, in preschool (3-5 year-old) children with mild to moderate OSA. METHODS: This protocol is for an ongoing multi-centred RCT with a recruitment target of 210 subjects (105 in each arm). Children age 3-5 years with symptoms of OSA, are recruited through doctor referral, at the point of referral to the Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) services. Screening is initially with a questionnaire (Paediatric Sleep Questionnaire, PSQ) for symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Where questionnaires are positive (suggestive of OSA) and ENT surgeons recommend them for adenotonsillectomy, they are invited to participate in POSTA. Baseline testing includes neurocognitive testing (IQ and psychometric evaluation with the neuropsychologist blinded to randomisation) and overnight polysomnography (PSG). Where the Obstructive Apnoea-Hypopnea Index (OAHI) from the PSG is <10/h per hour, consent for randomisation is sought; children with severe OSA (OAHI >/= 10/h) are sent for immediate treatment and excluded from the study. After consent is obtained, participants are randomised to early surgery (within 2 months) or to surgery after a usual wait time of 12 months. Follow-up studies include repeat neurocognitive testing and PSG at 12 (with the waiting list group studied before their surgery) and 24 months after randomisation. Analysis will be by intention to treat. The primary outcome is IQ at 12 months' follow-up. DISCUSSION: If IQ deficits associated with OSA are reversible 12 months after adenotonsillectomy compared to controls, future clinical practice advise would be to undertake early surgery in young children with OSA. The study could provide data on whether a window of opportunity exists for reversing IQ deficits linked to OSA in the pre-school age-group.

METHODS: Forty-two primary school-aged children (n = 21 with RS, n = 21 age- and sex-matched controls) underwent polysomnography, intelligence testing (\"Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition\" [WISC-V]), and anthropometrics. Families completed a 7-day sleep diary and questionnaires on sleep and behavior (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire [CSHQ] and the Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]). RESULTS: In children with RS (17 non-syndromic, four syndromic; median age 9.7 [8.5-10.8] years), the obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) was significantly higher than in controls (1.3 [0.4-2.7]/h vs. 0.4 [0.1-0.6]/h). Two syndromic children with RS were already on nocturnal respiratory support for OSA prior to our study, and one non-syndromic child was diagnosed with severe OSA (OAHI 57/h) despite an unremarkable medical history and questionnaire. The overall intelligence quotient in children with RS was within the normal range and did not differ between children with RS and healthy peers (102 vs. 108, p = .05). However, children with RS had values in the at-risk clinical range for externalizing behavior.

METHODS: Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were obtained from 31 6-7-year-olds, including nine children who do not stutter (CWNS), 11 children who had recovered from stuttering (CWS-Rec), and 11 children who persisted in stuttering (CWS-Per), matched for age, and all with similar socioeconomic status, nonverbal intelligence, and language ability. We examined ERPs elicited by semantic and syntactic (phrase structure) violations within an auditory narrative consisting of English and Jabberwocky sentences. In Jabberwocky sentences, content words were replaced with pseudowords to limit semantic context. A mixed effects repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was computed for ERP components with four within-subject factors, including condition, hemisphere, anterior/posterior distribution, and laterality. RESULTS: During the comprehension of English sentences, ERP activity mediating semantic and syntactic (phrase structure) processing did not distinguish CWS-Per, CWS-Rec, and CWNS. Semantic violations elicited a qualitatively similar N400 component across groups. Phrase structure violations within English sentences also elicited a similar P600 component in all groups. However, identical phrase structure violations within Jabberwocky sentences elicited a P600 in CWNS and CWS-Rec, but an N400-like effect in CWS-Per. CONCLUSIONS: The distinguishing neural patterns mediating syntactic, but not semantic, processing provide evidence that specific brain functions for some aspects of language processing may be associated with stuttering persistence. Unlike CWS-Rec and CWNS, the lack of semantic context in Jabberwocky sentences seemed to affect the syntactic processing strategies of CWS-Per, resulting in the elicitation of semantically based N400-like activity during syntactic (phrase structure) violations. This vulnerability suggests neural mechanisms associated with the processing of syntactic structure may be less mature in 6-7-year-old children whose stuttering persisted compared to their fluent or recovered peers.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Developmental stuttering is a multi-factorial disorder. Measures of neural activity while children processed the phonological (language sound unit) properties of words have revealed neurodevelopmental differences between fluent children and those who stutter. However, there is limited evidence to show whether the neural bases of phonological processing can be used to identify stuttering recovery status. As an initial step, we aimed to determine if differences in neural activity during phonological processing could aid in distinguishing children who had recovered from stuttering and those whose stuttering persisted. METHODS: We examined neural activity mediating phonological processing in forty-three 7-8 year old children. Groups included children who had recovered from stuttering (CWS-Rec), those whose stuttering persisted (CWS-Per), and children who did not stutter (CWNS). All children demonstrated normal non-verbal intelligence and language skills. Electroencephalograms were recorded as the children listened to pairs of pseudo-words (primes-targets) that either rhymed or did not. Behavioral rhyme judgments along with peak latency and mean amplitude of the N400s elicited by prime and target stimuli were examined. RESULTS: All the groups were very accurate in their rhyme judgments and displayed a typical ERP rhyme effect, characterized by increased N400 amplitudes over central parietal sites for nonrhyming targets compared to rhyming targets. However, over anterior electrode sites, an earlier onset of the N400 for rhyming compared to non-rhyming targets, indexing phonological segmentation and rehearsal, was observed in the CWNS and CWS-Rec groups. This effect occurred bilaterally for the CWNS, was greater over the right hemisphere in the CWS-Rec, and was absent in the CWS-Per. CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first to show that differences in ERPs reflecting phonological processing are marked by atypical lateralization in childhood even after stuttering recovery and more pronounced atypical neural patterns for the children whose stuttering persisted. Despite comparable language and phonological skills as revealed by standardized tests, the neural activity mediating phonological segmentation and rehearsal differentiated 7-8 year old children whose stuttering persisted from those who had recovered from stuttering and typically developing peers.\n",

            "\"Book language\" offers a richer linguistic experience than typical conversational speech in terms of its syntactic properties. Here, we investigated the role of long-term syntactic experience on syntactic knowledge and processing. In a preregistered study with 161 adult native Dutch speakers with varying levels of literacy, we assessed the contribution of individual differences in written language experience to offline and online syntactic processes. Offline syntactic knowledge was assessed as accuracy in an auditory grammaticality judgement task in which we tested violations of four Dutch grammatical norms. Online syntactic processing was indexed by syntactic priming of the Dutch dative alternation, using a comprehension-to-production priming paradigm with auditory presentation. Controlling for the contribution of nonverbal intelligence quotient (IQ), verbal working memory, and processing speed, we observed a robust effect of literacy experience on the detection of grammatical norm violations in spoken sentences, suggesting that exposure to the syntactic complexity and diversity of written language has specific benefits for general (modality-independent) syntactic knowledge. We replicated previous results by finding robust comprehension-to-production structural priming, both with and without lexical overlap between prime and target. Although literacy experience affected the usage of syntactic alternates in our large sample, it did not modulate their priming. We conclude that amount of experience with written language increases explicit awareness of grammatical norm violations and changes the usage of (prepositional-object [PO] vs. double-object [DO]) dative spoken sentences but has no detectable effect on their implicit syntactic priming in proficient language users. These findings constrain theories about the effect of long-term experience on syntactic processing.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: The Procedural Deficit Hypothesis (PDH) proposes that individuals with primary developmental language impairment (DLI) have a deficient procedural memory, compromising their syntactic abilities. Individuals with DLI may compensate for procedural memory deficits by engaging declarative memory for syntactic tasks. Arguments are part of the lexicon whereas adjuncts rely on syntactic processing. As a result, individuals with DLI may have unusual difficulty processing adjuncts. Alternatively, processing for adjuncts may be typical for individuals with DLI but show frequency effects, indicating compensatory use of declarative memory. AIMS: Our goal was to test the predictions of the PDH by comparing argument and adjunct processing times for adults with and without DLI, and to seek evidence of compensatory use of declarative memory for adjunct processing. We further evaluated group performance on measures of visual procedural and declarative memory. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Forty-four adults, 21 with DLI, completed a self-paced listening task, a procedural memory task, and a declarative memory task. The self-paced listening task tracked the word-by-word processing time for sentences that included prepositional phrases acting as arguments or adjuncts. We used regression analysis to determine effects of group membership and argument or adjunct status on processing times. Correlation analyses evaluated relationships between argument and adjunct frequency on processing times by group. RESULTS AND OUTCOMES: We found no effect of group membership on the processing time for arguments and adjuncts in the self-paced listening task. Argument phrases were processed more easily by both groups. There were frequency effects for adjunct processing for the group with DLI, but not the group with typical language. We did not find the expected frequency effects for argument processing. The group with DLI also performed more poorly in both the procedural and declarative memory tasks. Secondary analyses found that non-verbal intelligence was related to outcomes on the declarative memory but not the procedural memory task. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We found mixed evidence on the predictions of the PDH. Adults with DLI may compensate for procedural memory deficits but it is unclear whether this depends on declarative memory or language processing experience. Compensatory processing is an important element of the language profile for adults with DLI. LEARNING OUTCOMES: The readers will be able to describe how processing arguments and adjuncts in sentences may depend on different memory systems, and how adults with developmental language impairment may compensate for syntactic processing deficits.\n",

Sleep deprivation is also associated with reduced prefrontal-amygdala functional connectivity, potentially reflecting impaired top-down modulation of emotion. It remains unknown whether this modified connectivity may be observed in relation to more typical levels of sleep curtailment. We examined whether self-reported sleep duration the night before an assessment would be associated with these effects. DESIGN: Participants documented their hours of sleep from the previous night, completed the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i), Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT), and Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI), and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). SETTING: Outpatient neuroimaging center at a private psychiatric hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-five healthy adults (33 men, 32 women), ranging in age from 18-45 y. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Greater self-reported sleep the preceding night was associated with higher scores on all scales of the EQ-i but not the MSCEIT, and with lower symptom severity scores on half of the psychopathology scales of the PAI. Longer sleep was also associated with stronger negative functional connectivity between the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Moreover, greater negative connectivity between these regions was associated with higher EQ-i and lower symptom severity on the PAI.

            "STUDY OBJECTIVES: In young adults, sleep is associated with important changes in cerebral connectivity during the first cycle of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Our study aimed to evaluate how electroencephalography (EEG) connectivity during sleep differs between young and older individuals, and across the sleep cycles. METHODS: We used imaginary coherence to estimate EEG connectivity during NREM and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in 30 young (14 women; 20-30 years) and 29 older (18 women; 50-70 years) individuals. We also explored the association between coherence and cognitive measures. RESULTS: Older individuals showed lower EEG connectivity in stage N2 but higher connectivity in REM and stage N3 compared to the younger cohort. Age-related differences in N3 were driven by the first sleep cycle. EEG connectivity was lower in REM than N3, especially in younger individuals. Exploratory analyses, controlling for the effects of age, indicated that higher EEG connectivity in delta during N2 was associated with higher processing speed, whereas, during REM sleep, lower EEG connectivity in delta and sigma was associated with higher verbal memory performance and a higher global averaged intelligence quotient score. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that age modifies sleep EEG connectivity but the direction and the magnitude of these effects differ between sleep stages and cycles. Results in N3 and REM point to a reduced ability of the older brains to disconnect as compared to the younger ones. Our results also support the notion that cerebral functional connectivity during sleep may be associated with cognitive functions.\n",

            "Variations in the anatomical and functional connectivity between brain areas underlie both healthy and pathological variation in psychological measures. Largely independent from external stimuli, the sleep EEG is particularly well suited to measure individual variations in functional brain connectivity. In this study of 172 healthy individuals (17-69 years old), we show that functional connectivity between distant brain areas-reflected by the weighted phase lag index of the sleep EEG-is strongly affected by the age and sex of participants. Both NREM and REM connectivity in the theta and beta range increased with age, whereas a decrease was seen in the sigma range. Connectivity was substantially greater in females than in males in the high sigma frequency range, but an opposite pattern was seen in the alpha/low sigma and beta range. General intelligence was not significantly associated with connectivity in either sex. Our results confirm strong age effects on sleep spindle-frequency activity, which loses synchrony as a function of aging. Furthermore, we found support for a vigilance state-independent age-related increase in high beta power, previously demonstrated in waking EEG studies. The results highlight that future studies establishing sleep EEG connectivity measures as psychological or psychiatric biomarkers should take into account that sleep EEG synchronization is strongly affected by age and sex, and clinical thresholds must be adjusted accordingly.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Difficulty in controlling emotional impulses is a crucial component of borderline personality disorder (BPD) that often leads to destructive, impulsive behaviours against others. In line with recent findings in aggressive individuals, deficits in prefrontal amygdala coupling during emotional action control may account for these symptoms. METHODS: To study the neurobiological correlates of altered emotional action control in individuals with BPD, we asked medication-free, anger-prone, female patients with BPD and age- and intelligence-matched healthy women to take part in an approach-avoidance task while lying in an MRI scanner. The task required controlling fast behavioural tendencies to approach happy and avoid angry faces. Additionally, before the task we collected saliva testosterone and self-reported information on tendencies to act out anger and correlated this with behavioural and functional MRI (fMRI) data. RESULTS: We included 30 patients and 28 controls in our analysis. Patients with BPD reported increased tendencies to act out anger and were faster in approaching than avoiding angry faces than with healthy women, suggesting deficits in emotional action control in women with BPD. On a neural level, controlling fast emotional action tendencies was associated with enhanced activation in the antero- and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex across groups. Healthy women showed a negative coupling between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right amygdala, whereas this was absent in patients with BPD. LIMITATIONS: Specificity of results to BPD and sex differences remain unknown owing to the lack of clinical control groups and male participants. CONCLUSION: The results indicate reduced lateral prefrontal-amygdala communication during emotional action control in anger-prone women with BPD. The findings provide a possible neural mechanism underlying difficulties with controlling emotional impulses in patients with BPD.\n",

Fifty patients were treated by the modified Children's Cancer Group (CCG) 1991 protocol with low dose methotrexate and 50 children were treated by Total XV protocol with high dose methotrexate. Fifty healthy children were included as a control group. Psychometric assessment using Arabic version of Wechsler intelligence scale for children (WISC III) was performed for all patients and controls. RESULTS: Patients had significantly lower mean full scale IQ, performance IQ and verbal IQ than controls. Patients </= 5 years at diagnosis had significantly lower mean full scale IQ and performance IQ than patients>5 years at diagnosis, while the verbal IQ showed no significant difference between both age groups. Female patients had significantly lower mean full scale IQ, performance IQ and verbal IQthan males.

We studied brain morphology and neurocognitive functions in adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood acute, low and standard risk lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which was successfully treated with chemotherapy. We expected that intravenous and intrathecal chemotherapy administered in childhood will affect grey matter structures, including hippocampus and olfactory bulbs, areas where postnatal neurogenesis is ongoing. METHODS: We examined 27 ALL-survivors and 27 age-matched healthy controls, ages 15-22 years. ALL-survivors developed disease prior to their 11th birthday without central nervous system involvement, were treated with intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy and received no radiation. Volumes of grey, white matter and olfactory bulbs were measured on T1 and T2 magnetic resonance images manually, using FIRST (FMRIB's integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Memory, executive functions, attention, intelligence and olfaction were assessed. RESULTS: Mean volumes of left hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and nucleus accumbens were smaller in the ALL group. VBM analysis revealed significantly smaller volumes of the left calcarine gyrus, both lingual gyri and the left precuneus. DTI data analysis provided no evidence for white matter pathology. Lower scores in hippocampus-dependent memory were measured in ALL-subjects, while lower figural memory correlated with smaller hippocampal volumes. INTERPRETATION: Findings demonstrate that childhood ALL, treated with chemotherapy, is associated with smaller grey matter volumes of neocortical and subcortical grey matter and lower hippocampal memory performance in adolescence and adulthood.\n",

            "PURPOSE: To examine associations among methotrexate pharmacodynamics, neuroimaging, and neurocognitive outcomes in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated on a contemporary chemotherapy-only protocol. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This longitudinal study linked pharmacokinetic assays collected during therapy to neurocognitive and brain imaging outcomes during long-term follow-up. A total of 218 (72.2%) of 302 eligible long-term survivors were recruited for outcome studies when they were more than 5 years post-diagnosis and older than 8 years of age. At long-term follow-up, survivors were an average of 13.8 years old and 7.7 years from diagnosis, and 51% were male. Neurocognitive testing, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during an executive function task, and structural MRI with diffusion tensor imaging were conducted. Generalized linear models were developed to identify predictors, and models were adjusted for age at diagnosis, sex, and parent education. RESULTS: Intelligence was within normal limits (mean, 98; standard deviation, 14) compared with population expectations (mean, 100; standard deviation, 15), though measures of executive function, processing speed, and memory were less than population means (all P < .02 after correction for false discovery rates). Higher plasma concentration of methotrexate was associated with a poorer executive function score (P < .02). Higher plasma methotrexate was also associated with higher functional MRI activity, with thicker cortices in dorsolateral prefrontal brain regions, and with white matter microstructure in the frontostriatal tact. Neurocognitive impairment was associated with these imaging findings as well. Associations did not change after adjustment for age or dose of leucovorin rescue. CONCLUSION: Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated on contemporary chemotherapy-only protocols demonstrate executive dysfunction. A higher plasma concentration of methotrexate was associated with executive dysfunction as well as with a thicker cortex and higher activity in frontal brain regions, regions often associated with executive function.\n",

            "OBJECTIVES: The overall goal of this study was to compare verbal and visuospatial working memory in children with normal hearing (NH) and with cochlear implants (CI). The main questions addressed by this study were (1) Does auditory deprivation result in global or domain-specific deficits in working memory in children with CIs compared with their NH age mates? (2) Does the potential for verbal recoding affect performance on measures of reasoning ability in children with CIs relative to their NH age mates? and (3) Is performance on verbal and visuospatial working memory tasks related to spoken receptive language level achieved by children with CIs? DESIGN: A total of 54 children ranging in age from 5 to 9 years participated; 25 children with CIs and 29 children with NH. Participants were tested on both simple and complex measures of verbal and visuospatial working memory. Vocabulary was assessed with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) and reasoning abilities with two subtests of the WISC-IV (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition): Picture Concepts (verbally mediated) and Matrix Reasoning (visuospatial task). Groups were compared on all measures using analysis of variance after controlling for age and maternal education. RESULTS: Children with CIs scored significantly lower than children with NH on measures of working memory, after accounting for age and maternal education. Differences between the groups were more apparent for verbal working memory compared with visuospatial working memory. For reasoning and vocabulary, the CI group scored significantly lower than the NH group for PPVT and WISC Picture Concepts but similar to NH age mates on WISC Matrix Reasoning. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest that children with CIs have deficits in working memory related to storing and processing verbal information in working memory. These deficits extend to receptive vocabulary and verbal reasoning and remain even after controlling for the higher maternal education level of the NH group. Their ability to store and process visuospatial information in working memory and complete reasoning tasks that minimize verbal labeling of stimuli more closely approaches performance of NH age mates.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Cognitive deficits after perinatal brain lesion in preterm infants are among the most common neurodevelopmental disturbances. The relationship between structural changes on at term magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive deficits in the preschool age should be a special focus due to timely intervention. The aim of this study was to correlate qualitative and quantitative MRI parameters of perinatal brain lesion in preterm children, on early neonatal MRI and follow up MRI, with general and specific cognitive functions in the preschool age. METHODS: Twenty-one preterm infants with verified perinatal lesions based on clinical and ultrasound data underwent a brain MRI at term-equivalent age and a second MRI between 3 and 5 years of age. Qualitative and quantitative MRI analyses were done. All subjects underwent cognitive assessment (3-5 years) using Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-III) and Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment (NEPSY-II). RESULTS: Results show that many structural changes on at term MRI and on follow up MRI in preterm born children moderately correlate with specific cognitive deficits in preschool age. At term equivalent MRI, white matter changes and cortical thickness correlate to general and specific cognitive functions in infants born preterm. By analyzing follow up MRI at preschool age, structural changes of different white matter segments, corpus callosum, cortical thickness and lobe volume correlate to some specific cognitive functions. CONCLUSION: Besides general cognitive delay, specific cognitive deficits in preterm children should be targeted in research and intervention, optimally combined with MRI scanning, providing timely and early intervention of cognitive deficits after perinatal brain lesion. Our results, as well as previously published results, suggest the importance of detailed preschool neuropsychological assessment, prior to enrolment in the school system. Although preliminary, our results expand our understanding of the relationship between early brain developmental lesions and cognitive outcome following premature birth.\n",

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for 82 preterm infants who were born in the Department of Obstetrics of the First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017, and these infants were hospitalized after birth in the Department of Neonatology of the hospital. They were regularly followed up to observe growth and development and thyroid function at the outpatient service of the Department of Neonatology. According to thyroid function test results, they were divided into an abnormal thyroid function group (observation group; n=31) and a normal thyroid function group (control group; n=51). The infants in the observation group were given oral administration of levothyroxine sodium tablets, while those in the control group were not given any treatment. The two groups were compared in terms of the physical and intelligence development and thyroid function of preterm infants with various gestational ages (28-<32 weeks, 32-<34 weeks, and 34-<37 weeks) after regular follow-up to the corrected age of 12 months. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in physical development indices (body length, body weight, and head circumference) between the observation and control groups at various gestational ages after follow-up to the corrected age of 12 months (P>0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the scores of each functional area of the Gesell Developmental Scale among the preterm infants with a gestational age of 28-<32 weeks and 32-<34 weeks after follow-up to the corrected age of 12 months (P>0.05). For the preterm infants with a gestational age of 34-<37 weeks, compared with the control group, the observation group had a significantly lower score of gross motor ability at the age of 3 and 12 months, significantly lower scores of fine motor ability, language ability, and adaptation ability at the age of 12 months (P<0.05), and a significantly lower score of personal-social ability at the age of 3 months (P<0.05). However, the score of personal-social ability in the observation group was not significantly different from the control group at the age of 12 months (P>0.05). After 2-4 weeks of treatment with levothyroxine sodium tablets, the thyroid function of the 31 preterm infants with thyroid dysfunction returned to normal. Among the 31 infants, 21 (68%) achieved complete drug withdrawal, with normal results of neonatal screening (100%); 10 infants (32%) failed to achieve drug withdrawal, and only 2 (20%) out of the 10 infants had normal neonatal screening results (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and reasonable treatment can reduce the impact on growth and development in preterm infants with thyroid dysfunction. Most preterm infants tend to have transient thyroid dysfunction, while those with positive results of neonatal screening are more likely to develop permanent thyroid dysfunction.\n",

However, early identification of infants at risk for poor cognition is still a challenge, as no clear association between pathological findings based on neuroimaging scans and cognitive functions have been detected as yet. The Prechtl General Movement Assessment (GMA) has shown its merits for the evaluation of the integrity of the young nervous system. It is a reliable tool for identifying infants at risk for neuromotor deficits. Recent studies on preterm infants demonstrate that abnormal general movements (GMs) also reflect impairments of brain areas involved in cognitive development. The aim of this systematic review was to discuss studies that included (i) the Prechtl GMA applied in preterm infants, and (ii) cognitive outcome measures in six data bases. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria and yielded the following results: (a) children born preterm with consistently abnormal GMs up to 8 weeks after term had lower intelligence quotients at school age than children with an early normalization of GMs; (b) from 3 to 5 months after term, several qualitative, and quantitative aspects of the concurrent motor repertoire, including postural patterns, were predictive of intelligence at 7-10 years of age. These findings in 428 individuals born preterm suggest that normal GMs along with a normal motor repertoire during the first months after term are markers for normal cognitive development until at least age 10.\n",

METHOD: The study was a retrospective hospital-based study of preterm infants with a frontal PVHI (n=21; 11 males, 10 females; mean birthweight 1527g; mean gestational age 30.3wks) or temporal PVHI (n=13; five males, eight females; mean birthweight 1205g; mean gestational age 30.2wks) admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit between 1990 and 2012. The clinical course, results of neuroimaging studies, and neurodevelopmental outcomes of preterm infants with a gestational age less than 34 weeks with a confirmed PVHI on early cranial ultrasonography and/or magnetic resonance imaging were reviewed. For assessment of neurodevelopmental outcome we used the Griffiths Mental Development Scales, the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, the Gross Motor Function Classification System, the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, the Child Behavior Checklist, and ophthalmological assessment. An unfavourable neurodevelopmental outcome was defined as moderately or severely atypical neurological examination during the last visit: presence of cerebral palsy, epilepsy, a hearing or visual impairment, and/or atypical cognitive development (Griffiths Mental Development Scales developmental quotient or Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence <85). RESULTS: Unfavourable outcome was observed in 12 out of 13 children with a temporal PVHI compared with six out of 21 children with a frontal PVHI (p=0.002). Only one of the included infants with a PVHI in the temporal white matter developed cerebral palsy, which was due to a parietal PVHI in the contralateral hemisphere. Cognitive impairment was noted in seven infants with a frontal PVHI and five with a temporal PVHI. There were more infants with a temporal PVHI who developed visual impairment (n=5) or behavioural problems (n=7) compared with those with a frontal PVHI (visual impairment (n=2), behavioural problems (n=3). INTERPRETATION: PVHI located in the temporal or frontal lobe is almost invariably related to a typical motor outcome, but carries a risk of cognitive, behavioural, and visual problems, especially in infants with a PVHI located in the temporal lobe.\n",

Non-word reading ability, verbal and non-verbal IQ, and standardized academic achievement (Queensland Core Skills Test; QCST) were measured in Australian twins (up to 876 twin pairs and 80 singleton twins). Multivariate genetic analysis showed the presence of a general genetic factor, likely reflecting crystallized ability, which accounted for 45-76% of phenotypic variance in QCST scores, 62% of variance in Verbal IQ, 23% of variance in Performance IQ, and 19% of variance in phonological reading ability. The phonemic decoding genetic factor (explaining 48% of variance in phonemic decoding) was negatively associated with mathematical achievement scores (0.4%). Shared effects of common environment did not explain the relationship between reading ability and academic achievement beyond those also influencing IQ. The unique environmental reading factor (accounting for 26% of variance) influenced academic abilities related to written expression. Future research will need to address whether these reading-specific genetic and unique environment relationships arise from causal effects of reading on scholastic abilities, or whether both share a common influence, such as pleiotropic genes/environmental factors.\n",

Methods: Children between 4 and 5 years (N = 57) were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Woodcock Johnson Early Cognitive and Academic Development Test (ECAD) was utilized to assess General Intellectual Ability, Early Academic Skills, and Expressive Language. DXA was used to assess VAT. Diet quality was measured using the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) based on 7-day food records. Results: Greater VAT was associated with poorer Early Academic Skills (r = -0.28, P = 0.03) whereas a diet pattern that included Fatty Acids, Whole Grains, Saturated Fats, Seafood and Plant Proteins, Total Vegetables, and Dairy was positively associated with General Intellectual Ability (r = 0.26, P = 0.04). Conclusions: Higher VAT is negatively related to Early Academic Skills whereas diet quality was positively and selectively related to intellectual abilities among preschool-age children.

METHOD: Our sample consisted of a total of 102 individuals: 28 individuals living with HIV and cocaine dependence (HIV+/CD), 28 individuals who are HIV-negative with cocaine dependence (HIV-/CD), 20 individuals living with HIV without cocaine dependence (HIV+/ND), and 26 individuals who are HIV-negative without cocaine dependence (HIV-/ND). We utilized the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised Version (HVLT-R) to assess components of verbal memory, including encoding, recall, and recognition. A 2 (HIV: Yes/No) x 2 (Cocaine: Yes/No) MANCOVA on Total and Delayed Recall while controlling for premorbid intelligence was conducted. We used a Kruskal-Wallis H test to examine retrieval and recognition. RESULTS: The combination of HIV and cocaine dependence amplified deficits on Total Recall. We found comparably poor performance across Delayed Recall between all three clinical groups. People living with HIV without cocaine dependence demonstrated intact recognition, whereas those with cocaine dependence had poor recognition. CONCLUSIONS: HIV and cocaine both impacted verbal memory. However, there are potential subtle differences in the role cocaine versus HIV has on the memory process. People living with HIV without cocaine dependence recognized significantly more words than they could freely recall. In contrast, cocaine dependence impacted recognition in HIV and non-HIV groups. These performance patterns suggest HIV may be associated with retrieval deficits, whereas cocaine dependence may be associated with encoding deficits. Further research assessing these specific components of the memory process will help clarify these potential differences.\n",

While tissue injury in cortical and subcortical regions in the brain of adult HIV patients has been well reported there is sparse knowledge about these changes in perinatally HIV infected pediatric patients. We analyzed cortical thickness, subcortical volume, structural connectivity, and neurocognitive functions in pediatric HIV patients and compared with those of pediatric healthy controls. With informed consent, 34 perinatally infected pediatric HIV patients and 32 age and gender matched pediatric healthy controls underwent neurocognitive assessment and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a 3 T clinical scanner. Altered cortical thickness, subcortical volumes, and abnormal neuropsychological test scores were observed in pediatric HIV patients. The structural network connectivity analysis depicted lower connection strengths, lower clustering coefficients, and higher path length in pediatric HIV patients than healthy controls. The network betweenness and network hubs in cortico-limbic regions were distorted in pediatric HIV patients. The findings suggest that altered cortical and subcortical structures and regional brain connectivity in pediatric HIV patients may contribute to deficits in their neurocognitive functions. Further, longitudinal studies are required for better understanding of the effect of HIV pathogenesis on brain structural changes throughout the brain development process under standard ART treatment.\n",

Among them, the dopamine (DAT), serotonin (SERT), and norepinephrine (NET) transporters are three major targets. Each of these targets has a large protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, which must be considered in the anticocaine addiction drug discovery. This work presents DAT, SERT, and NET interactome network-informed machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL) studies of cocaine addiction. We collected and analyzed 61 protein targets out of 460 proteins in the DAT, SERT, and NET PPI networks that have sufficiently large existing inhibitor datasets. Utilizing autoencoder (AE) and other ML/DL algorithms, including gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and multitask deep neural network (MT-DNN), we built predictive models for these targets with 115 407 inhibitors to predict drug repurposing potential and possible side effects. We further screened their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties to search for leads having potential for developing treatments for cocaine addiction. Our approach offers a new systematic protocol for artificial intelligence (AI)-based anticocaine addiction lead discovery.\n",

            "Tensor-Based Morphometry (TBM) allows the automatic mapping of brain changes across time building 3D deformation maps. This technique has been applied for tracking brain degeneration in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases with high sensitivity and reliability. Here we applied TBM to quantify changes in brain structure after completing a challenging adaptive cognitive training program based on the n-back task. Twenty-six young women completed twenty-four training sessions across twelve weeks and they showed, on average, large cognitive improvements. High-resolution MRI scans were obtained before and after training. The computed longitudinal deformation maps were analyzed for answering three questions: (a) Are there differential brain structural changes in the training group as compared with a matched control group? (b) Are these changes related to performance differences in the training program? (c) Are standardized changes in a set of psychological factors (fluid and crystallized intelligence, working memory, and attention control) measured before and after training, related to structural changes in the brain? Results showed (a) greater structural changes for the training group in the temporal lobe, (b) a negative correlation between these changes and performance across training sessions (the greater the structural change, the lower the cognitive performance improvements), and (c) negligible effects regarding the psychological factors measured before and after training.\n",

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to study the effects of antenatal glucocorticoid treatment and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) polymorphisms on behavior and intelligence quotient (IQ). DESIGN: This study was part of the 19-year follow-up of the Project On Preterm and Small-for-gestational-age birth cohort. SETTING: Multicenter study. PATIENTS: Three hundred forty-four 19-year-olds born very preterm (gestational age < 32 wk), of whom 71 had received betamethasone antenatally. INTERVENTION: Single antenatal treatment course of betamethasone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Behavior (Young Adult Self Report and Young Adult Behavior Checklist for parents) and IQ (digital Multicultural Capacity Test-intermediate level). Data were analyzed by linear regression and presented as regression coefficient (95% confidence interval [CI]). RESULTS: Sex ratio, GR (R23K; N363S) and MR (-2G/C; I180V) genotypes were equally distributed between treated and nontreated subjects. Independent of treatment, R23K carriers had improved IQ scores (beta 9.3; 95% CI, 3.4 to 15.1) and a tendency toward more favorable total problem behavior scores (beta -8.5; 95% CI, -17.3 to 0.2) ; -2G/C CC carriers had poorer IQ scores (beta -6.2; 95% CI, -10.5 to -1.9); I180V carriers had more favorable internalizing behavior scores (beta -2.0; 95% CI, -3.9 to -0.1). Antenatal glucocorticoid treatment was associated with more unfavorable behavior scores, especially internalizing behavior (beta 2.4; 95% CI, 0.3 to 4.5). Interaction between GR and MR polymorphisms and antenatal glucocorticoid treatment was observed, with poorer IQ scores for exposed N363S carriers; poorer intellectual subdomain scores for exposed I180V-carriers; more favorable total problem behavior scores for exposed R23K carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variations in glucocorticoid sensitivity and antenatal glucocorticoid treatment are associated with IQ and behavior in young adult preterm survivors.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Dogs with hypoadrenocorticism (HA) have clinical signs and clinicopathologic abnormalities that can be mistaken as other diseases. In dogs with a differential diagnosis of HA, a machine learning model (MLM) has been validated to discriminate between HA and other diseases. This MLM has not been evaluated as a screening tool for a broader group of dogs. HYPOTHESIS: An MLM can accurately screen dogs for HA. ANIMALS: Dogs (n = 1025) examined at a veterinary hospital. METHODS: Dogs that presented to a tertiary referral hospital that had a CBC and serum chemistry panel were enrolled. A trained MLM was applied to clinicopathologic data and in dogs that were MLM positive for HA, diagnosis was confirmed by measurement of serum cortisol. RESULTS: Twelve dogs were MLM positive for HA and had further cortisol testing. Five had HA confirmed (true positive), 4 of which were treated for mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid deficiency, and 1 was treated for glucocorticoid deficiency alone. Three MLM positive dogs had baseline cortisol </=2 mug/dL but were euthanized or administered glucocorticoid treatment without confirming the diagnosis with an ACTH-stimulation test (classified as \"undetermined\"), and in 4, HA was ruled out (false positives). The positive likelihood ratio of the MLM was 145 to 254. All dogs diagnosed with HA by attending clinicians tested positive by the MLM. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This MLM can robustly predict HA status when indiscriminately screening all dogs with blood work. In this group of dogs with a low prevalence of HA, the false positive rates were clinically acceptable.\n",

This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence model to assess glucocorticoid efficacy according to the HRCT imaging features of IIP. The medical records and chest HRCT images of 150 patients with IIP were analyzed retrospectively. The U-net framework was used to create a model for recognizing different imaging features, including ground glass opacities, reticulations, honeycombing, and consolidations. Then, the area ratio of those imaging features was calculated automatically. Forty-five patients were treated with glucocorticoids, and according to the drug efficacy, they were divided into a glucocorticoid-sensitive group and a glucocorticoid-insensitive group. Models assessing the correlation between imaging features and glucocorticoid sensitivity were established using the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. The total accuracy (ACC) and mean intersection over union (mIoU) of the U-net model were 0.9755 and 0.4296, respectively. Out of the 45 patients treated with glucocorticoids, 34 and 11 were placed in the glucocorticoid-sensitive and glucocorticoid-insensitive groups, respectively. The KNN-based model had an accuracy of 0.82.

            "BACKGROUND: Survival of preterm very low birthweight infants resulted in high risk for developmental cognitive deficits, poor academic achievement, and behaviour disorders. While numerous studies evaluated the prevalence of neurodevelopmental disability in early childhood, poor literature is available for infants born very low birthweight in adulthood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five young adults born preterm (mean age: 18 +/- 2.42 years; <33 weeks of gestational age and/or with birth weight <1500 g) were enrolled. The Verbal Intelligence Quotient (vIQ), Performance Intelligence Quotient (pIQ) and Total Intelligence Quotient (tIQ) were assessed through the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Revised (WAIS-R). Personality profiles were investigated using Rorschach test. Both WAIS-R and Rorschach scores were subsequently compared to 13 matched controls born at term. Data were analysed with the SPSS v20 for Windows statistical package. RESULTS: Young adults born preterm showed lower IQ scores than young adults born at term: tIQ 90.95 +/- 22.46 versus 108.77 +/- 16.14, p = 0.006; vIQ 89.85 +/- 21.85 versus 107.69 +/- 18.33, p = 0.009, and pIQ 92.40 +/- 22.90 versus 108.31 +/- 14.52, p = 0.011. No differences emerged in personality profile as most subjects showed adequate internal resources in both groups, but a trend towards anxiety and insecurity were identified in young adult born preterm. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults born preterm show psychological fragility and lower cognitive pattern than young adults born at term. Data support the need of an early psychological intervention that could help these individuals at greater risk to face a young society that is changing and that necessarily requires stronger internal resources.\n",

Diagnosis of cognitive dysfunctions in patients with cerebral palsy is a difficult task, due to their diverse combination with motor, speech and sensory pathology, which requires an integrated approach. The article highlights in detail the modern directions of complex rehabilitation (including medical, social, psychological and pedagogical correction) of cognitive dysfunctions in children with cerebral palsy, in accordance with modern clinical recommendations and treatment standards.\n",

            "STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Artificial intelligence applications are increasing in prosthodontics. Still, the current development and performance of artificial intelligence in prosthodontic applications has not yet been systematically documented and analyzed. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the performance of the artificial intelligence models in prosthodontics for tooth shade selection, automation of restoration design, mapping the tooth preparation finishing line, optimizing the manufacturing casting, predicting facial changes in patients with removable prostheses, and designing removable partial dentures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic systematic review was performed in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus. A manual search was also conducted. Studies with artificial intelligence models were selected based on 6 criteria: tooth shade selection, automated fabrication of dental restorations, mapping the finishing line of tooth preparations, optimizing the manufacturing casting process, predicting facial changes in patients with removable prostheses, and designing removable partial dentures. Two investigators independently evaluated the quality assessment of the studies by applying the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Quasi-Experimental Studies (nonrandomized experimental studies). A third investigator was consulted to resolve lack of consensus. RESULTS: A total of 36 articles were reviewed and classified into 6 groups based on the application of the artificial intelligence model. One article reported on the development of an artificial intelligence model for tooth shade selection, reporting better shade matching than with conventional visual selection; 14 articles reported on the feasibility of automated design of dental restorations using different artificial intelligence models; 1 artificial intelligence model was able to mark the margin line without manual interaction with an average accuracy ranging from 90.6% to 97.4%; 2 investigations developed artificial intelligence algorithms for optimizing the manufacturing casting process, reporting an improvement of the design process, minimizing the porosity on the cast metal, and reducing the overall manufacturing time; 1 study proposed an artificial intelligence model that was able to predict facial changes in patients using removable prostheses; and 17 investigations that developed clinical decision support, expert systems for designing removable partial dentures for clinicians and educational purposes, computer-aided learning with video interactive programs for student learning, and automated removable partial denture design. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence models have shown the potential for providing a reliable diagnostic tool for tooth shade selection, automated restoration design, mapping the preparation finishing line, optimizing the manufacturing casting, predicting facial changes in patients with removable prostheses, and designing removable partial dentures, but they are still in development. Additional studies are needed to further develop and assess their clinical performance.\n",

            "PURPOSE: Long-term seizure and developmental outcomes of benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) are thought to be good. Studies have shown that behavioral disorders may accompany BECTS. We aimed to investigate the frequency of behavioral disorders in patients with BECTS and evaluate their relationship to epilepsy features. METHODS: Data for 41 patients with BECTS followed up at our clinic between December 2019 and June 2020 were analyzed. Behavioral disorders and intelligence were evaluated by the Turgay Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition - Disruptive Behaviour Disorders Rating Scale and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Revised, respectively. Patients with a diagnosis of BECTS were divided into 2 groups: children with a behavioral disorder and children without a behavioral disorder. Demographic characteristics, clinical and electroencephalography (EEG) findings, and intelligence level were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Twelve of the patients (29%) were classified as having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 2 (5%) were classified as having oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). The age at seizure onset was earlier in patients with behavioral disorders (p = 0.023). Bilateral interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) were more common in children with behavioral disorders than children without behavioral disorders (p = 0.039). The most preferred antiseizure medication was carbamazepine, followed by levetiracetam and valproic acid. The intelligence score of the patients with BECTS was in the normal range in both groups. The total, verbal, and performance scores were lower in patients with a behavioral disorder than in patients without a behavioral disorder, but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Behavioral disorders may be present in approximately one-third of patients with BECTS. Early onset of seizures and the presence of bilateral IEDs may be risk factors for behavioral disorders in children with BECTS.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: While the diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have evolved over the years, some children with impairing ADHD symptoms fail to meet the full diagnostic threshold for the disorder. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the morbidity and dysfunction of subsyndromal ADHD in the clinical setting. METHODS: Subthreshold and full ADHD subjects were derived from consecutive referrals (n = 2,947) to a pediatric psychopharmacology program at a major academic center. Subjects were diagnosed with subthreshold ADHD if they met at least 1 of the following criteria: (1) their age at onset for ADHD was >/= 7 years; (2) they had >/= 5 but < 8 ADHD symptoms using the DSM-III-R or >/= 4 but < 6 ADHD inattentive or hyperactive/impulsive symptoms using the DSM-IV. Healthy controls were derived from 2 identically designed longitudinal case-control studies of youth with and without ADHD. Psychiatric assessments relied on clinical structured interviews and measures of psychopathology, social functioning, cognitive ability, and academic achievement. RESULTS: Of the 1,931 children diagnosed with ADHD, 140 (7%) were diagnosed with subthreshold ADHD. 48% of subthreshold ADHD subjects had an age at onset >/= 7 years, and 73% had insufficient symptoms. Reanalysis of findings using DSM-5 criteria showed that only 21% of our subthreshold ADHD subjects would have met DSM-5 criteria based on age at onset of < 12 years, while 79% would have maintained their subthreshold diagnoses. Subjects with subthreshold ADHD differed from controls in the mean number of comorbid disorders; rates of mood, anxiety, and elimination disorders (all P < .001) and substance use disorders (P < .05); scores on all Child Behavior Checklist clinical and social functioning scales; scores on 7 of the 10 Social Adjustment Inventory for Children and Adolescents scales; rates of requiring extra help in school and being placed in a special class; and scores on 4 of the 5 Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised Version subscales (excluding Digit Span) as well as in Freedom from Distractibility Index score (P < .001). Subthreshold and full ADHD subjects had similarly elevated Global Assessment of Functioning scores versus controls (P < .001), but subjects with subthreshold ADHD had fewer perinatal complications and better family functioning scores and were more likely to be female and older and to come from families of higher socioeconomic status than subjects with full ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically referred children failing to meet full-threshold diagnosis for ADHD due to either insufficient symptoms or later age at onset have patterns of clinical features highly similar to those with the full syndrome. These results extend to previously reported findings in nonreferred samples documenting the high morbidity and disability associated with subthreshold ADHD.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: premorbid IQ (pIQ) and age of onset are predictors of clinical severity and long-term functioning after a first episode of psychosis. However, the additive influence of these variables on clinical, functional, and recovery rates outcomes is largely unknown. METHODS: we characterized 255 individuals who have experienced a first episode of psychosis in four a priori defined subgroups based on pIQ (low pIQ < 85; average pIQ >/= 85) and age of onset (early onset < 18 years; adult onset >/= 18 years). We conducted clinical and functional assessments at baseline and at two-year follow-up. We calculated symptom remission and recovery rates using the Positive and Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia Schedule (PANSS) and the Global Assessment Functioning (GAF or Children-GAF). We examined clinical and functional changes with pair-wise comparisons and two-way mixed ANOVA. We built hierarchical lineal and logistic regression models to estimate the predictive value of the independent variables over functioning or recovery rates. RESULTS: early-onset patients had more severe positive symptoms and poorer functioning than adult-onset patients. At two-year follow-up, only early-onset with low pIQ and adult-onset with average pIQ subgroups differed consistently, with the former having more negative symptoms (d = 0.59), poorer functioning (d = 0.82), lower remission (61% vs. 81.1%), and clinical recovery (34.1% vs. 62.2%). CONCLUSIONS: early-onset individuals with low pIQ may present persistent negative symptoms, lower functioning, and less recovery likelihood at two-year follow-up. Intensive cognitive and functional programs for these individuals merit testing to improve long-term recovery rates in this subgroup.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Studies on both personality dimensions and cognition in schizophrenia are scarce. The objective of the present study was to examine personality traits and the relation to cognitive function and psychotic symptoms in a sample of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. METHOD: In total 23 patients with schizophrenia and 14 controls were assessed with the Karolinska Scales of Personality (KSP). A broad cognitive test programme was used, including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales, the Finger-Tapping Test, the Trail Making Test, the Verbal Fluency Test, the Benton Visual Retention Test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test . RESULTS: Compared with controls, the patients exhibited prominent elevations on KSP scales measuring anxiety proneness and neuroticism (P = 0.000005-0.0001), on the Detachment scale (P < 0.00009) and lower value on the Socialization scale (P < 0.0002). The patients also scored higher on the Inhibition of Aggression, Suspicion, Guilt and Irritability scales (P = 0.002-0.03) while the remaining five scales did not differ between patients and controls. KSP anxiety-related scales correlated with the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) general psychopathology subscale. Cognitive test results were uniformly lower in the patient group and correlated with PANSS negative symptoms subscale. There was no association between KSP scale scores and PANSS positive or negative symptoms. CONCLUSION: The patients revealed a highly discriminative KSP test profile with elevated scores in neuroticism- and psychoticism-related scales as compared to controls. Results support previous findings utilizing other personality inventories in patients with schizophrenia. Cognitive test performance correlated inversely with negative symptoms.\n",

            "Negative symptoms and neurocognitive performance have been reported to be negatively associated in patients with emerging psychosis. However, most previous studies focused on patients with frank psychosis and did not differentiate between subdomains of negative symptoms. Hence, we aimed to elucidate the specific relationship between negative symptoms and cognitive functioning in patients at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. Data from 154 CHR patients collected within the prospective Fruherkennung von Psychosen (FePsy) study were analyzed. Negative symptoms were assessed with the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and cognitive functioning with an extensive neuropsychological test battery. Regression analyses revealed significant negative associations between negative symptoms and cognitive functioning, particularly in the domains of nonverbal intelligence and verbal fluency. When analyzing each negative symptom domain separately, alogia and asociality/anhedonia were significantly negatively associated with nonverbal intelligence and alogia additionally with verbal fluency. Overall, our results in CHR patients are similar to those reported in patients with frank psychosis. The strong negative association between verbal fluency and negative symptoms may be indicative of an overlap between these constructs. Verbal fluency might have a strong influence on the clinical impression of negative symptoms (particularly alogia) and vice versa.\n",

METHODS: Between June 2009 and April 2010, 316 grade 5 students aged 10-11 years were selected from four primary schools in four administrative districts of Changsha, China by stratified random sampling. The intelligence characteristics of children with varying degrees of sleep deprivation were investigated using the Chinese Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. RESULTS: A total of 286 valid questionnaires were received, with a response rate of 90.5%. The survey was comprised of a sleep deprivation group (sleep time <8 hours per night; n=180) and a control group (sleep time >/=8 hours per night; n=106). The sleep deprivation group had significantly lower subtest scores, verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ) and full scale IQ (P<0.05) and significantly lower verbal comprehension factor score and memory/attention factor score compared with the control group (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the moderate sleep deprivation subgroup had significantly decreased VIQ and full scale IQ as well as verbal comprehension factor score and memory/attention factor score (P<0.05), and the severe sleep deprivation subgroup showed decreases in all scores (P<0.05). The sleep deprivation group and moderate and severe sleep deprivation subgroups had significantly higher proportions of children with VIQ-PIQ imbalance than the control group.

Sleep deprivation is also associated with reduced prefrontal-amygdala functional connectivity, potentially reflecting impaired top-down modulation of emotion. It remains unknown whether this modified connectivity may be observed in relation to more typical levels of sleep curtailment. We examined whether self-reported sleep duration the night before an assessment would be associated with these effects. DESIGN: Participants documented their hours of sleep from the previous night, completed the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i), Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT), and Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI), and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). SETTING: Outpatient neuroimaging center at a private psychiatric hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-five healthy adults (33 men, 32 women), ranging in age from 18-45 y. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Greater self-reported sleep the preceding night was associated with higher scores on all scales of the EQ-i but not the MSCEIT, and with lower symptom severity scores on half of the psychopathology scales of the PAI. Longer sleep was also associated with stronger negative functional connectivity between the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Moreover, greater negative connectivity between these regions was associated with higher EQ-i and lower symptom severity on the PAI.

It is foreseeable that this exceptional situation will have psychological effects on citizens. In this work, the impact of confinement on perceived sleep quality and depression is evaluated through questionnaires, as well as the mediating role of Emotional Intelligence (EI) in this relationship. Our results show, firstly, higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in women and young people associated with poorer perceived sleep quality, and secondly, that Emotional Intelligence intervenes as a mediator in this relationship through three different pathways. Worse perceived quality of sleep causes a greater number of depressive symptoms. In addition, this direct relationship may be enhanced by the mediating role of Emotional Intelligence, which we can express in three different ways: low perceived sleep quality and high emotional attention lead to greater depression; low perceived sleep quality and low emotional clarity increase greater symptoms of depression; and low perceived sleep quality together with low clarity and low emotional repair increase levels of depression. Therefore, we can conclude that improving the skills involved in Emotional Intelligence might increase perceived sleep quality, and thus reduce depressive symptoms, which in turn may improve the quality of life.\n",

So why do they think that, and does it apply to dose monitoring? The move from retrospective dose evaluation to a proactive dose management approach represents a serious area of research. Indeed, artificial intelligence and machine learning are consistently being integrated into best-in-class dose management software solutions. The development of clinical analytics and dashboards are already supporting operators in their decision-making, and these optimisations - if taken beyond a single machine, a single department, or a single health network - have the potential to drive real and lasting change. The question is for whom exactly are these innovations being developed? How can the patient know that their scan has been performed to the absolute best that the technology can deliver? Do they know or even care how much their lifetime risk for developing cancer has changed post examination? Do they want a personalised size-specific dose estimate or perhaps an individual organ dose assessment to share on Instagram?

            "Purpose: Explainability and fairness are two key factors for the effective and ethical clinical implementation of deep learning-based machine learning models in healthcare settings. However, there has been limited work on investigating how unfair performance manifests in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods, and how XAI can be used to investigate potential reasons for unfairness. Thus, the aim of this work was to analyze the effects of previously established sociodemographic-related confounders on classifier performance and explainability methods. Approach: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to predict biological sex from T1-weighted brain MRI datasets of 4547 9- to 10-year-old adolescents from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. Performance disparities of the trained CNN between White and Black subjects were analyzed and saliency maps were generated for each subgroup at the intersection of sex and race. Results: The classification model demonstrated a significant difference in the percentage of correctly classified White male ( 90.3% +/- 1.7% ) and Black male ( 81.1% +/- 4.5% ) children. Conversely, slightly higher performance was found for Black female ( 89.3% +/- 4.8% ) compared with White female ( 86.5% +/- 2.0% ) children. Saliency maps showed subgroup-specific differences, corresponding to brain regions previously associated with pubertal development. In line with this finding, average pubertal development scores of subjects used in this study were significantly different between Black and White females ( p < 0.001 ) and males ( p < 0.001 ). Conclusions: We demonstrate that a CNN with significantly different sex classification performance between Black and White adolescents can identify different important brain regions when comparing subgroup saliency maps. Importance scores vary substantially between subgroups within brain structures associated with pubertal development, a race-associated confounder for predicting sex. We illustrate that unfair models can produce different XAI results between subgroups and that these results may explain potential reasons for biased performance.\n",

            "Successful social communication is complex; it relies on effectively deploying and continuously revising one's behavior to fit the needs of a given conversation, partner, and context. For example, a skilled conversationalist may instinctively become less talkative with a quiet partner and more talkative with a chattier one. Prior research suggests that behavioral flexibility across social contexts can be a particular challenge for individuals with autism spectrum condition (ASC), and that difficulty adapting to the changing needs of a conversation contributes to communicative breakdowns and poor social outcomes. In this study, we examine whether reduced conversational adaptation, as measured by talkativeness, differentiates 48 verbally fluent children and teens with ASC from 50 neurotypical (NT) peers matched on age, intelligence quotient, and sex ratio. Participants completed the Contextual Assessment of Social Skills with two novel conversation partners. The first acted interested in the conversation and talked more (Interested condition), while the second acted bored and talked less (Bored condition). Results revealed that NT participants emulated their conversation partner's behavior by being more talkative in the Interested condition as compared to the Bored condition (z = 9.92, p < 0.001). In contrast, the ASC group did not differentially adapt their behavior to the Bored versus Interested context, instead remaining consistently talkative in both (p = 0.88). The results of this study have implications for understanding social communication and behavioral adaptation in ASC, and may be valuable for clinicians interested in improving conversational competence in verbally fluent individuals with autism. LAY SUMMARY: Social communication-including everyday conversations-can be challenging for individuals on the autism spectrum. In successful conversations, people tend to adjust aspects of their language to be more similar to their partners'. In this study, we found that children and teens with autism did not change their own talkativeness in response to a social partner who was more or less talkative, whereas neurotypical peers did. These findings have clinical implications for improving conversational competence in verbally fluent individuals with autism.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: The GluN2B subunit of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors is crucially involved in the physiology of the prefrontal cortex during working memory (WM). Consistently, genetic variants in the GluN2B coding gene (GRIN2B) have been associated with cognitive phenotypes. However, it is unclear how GRIN2B genetic variation affects gene expression and prefrontal cognitive processing. Using a composite score, we tested the combined effect of GRIN2B variants on prefrontal activity during WM performance in healthy subjects. METHOD: We computed a composite score to combine the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms on post-mortem prefrontal GRIN2B mRNA expression. We then computed the composite score in independent samples of healthy participants in a peripheral blood expression study (n = 46), in a WM behavioural study (n = 116) and in a WM functional magnetic resonance imaging study (n = 122). RESULTS: Five polymorphisms were associated with GRIN2B expression: rs2160517, rs219931, rs11055792, rs17833967 and rs12814951 (all corrected p < 0.05). The score computed to account for their combined effect reliably indexed gene expression. GRIN2B composite score correlated negatively with intelligence quotient, WM behavioural efficiency and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity. Moreover, there was a non-linear association between GRIN2B genetic score and prefrontal activity, i.e. both high and low putative genetic score levels were associated with high blood oxygen level-dependent signals in the prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple genetic variants in GRIN2B are jointly associated with gene expression, prefrontal function and behaviour during WM. These results support the role of GRIN2B genetic variants in WM prefrontal activity in human adults.\n",

            "In both humans and mice, performance on tests of intelligence or general cognitive ability (GCA) is related to dopamine D1 receptor-mediated activity in the prelimbic cortex, and levels of DRD1 mRNA predict the GCA of mice. Here we assessed the turnover rate of D1 receptors as well as the expression level of the D1 chaperone protein (DRiP78) in the medial PPC (mPFC) of mice to determine whether rate of receptor turnover was associated with variations in the GCA of genetically heterogeneous mice. Following assessment of GCA (aggregate performance on four diverse learning tests) mice were administered an irreversible dopamine receptor antagonist (EEDQ), after which the density of new D1 receptors were quantified. GCA was positively correlated with both the rate of D1 receptor recovery and levels of DRiP78. Additionally, the density of D1 receptors was observed to increase within 60 min (or less) in response to intense demands on working memory, suggesting that a pool of immature receptors was available to accommodate high cognitive loads. These results provide evidence that innate general cognitive abilities are related to D1 receptor turnover rates in the prefrontal cortex, and that an intracellular pool of immature D1 receptors are available to accommodate cognitive demands.\n",

The prefrontal cortex plays a wide range of roles in executive functions, including active maintenance and achievement of goals, adaptive coding and exertion of general intelligence, and completion of time complexity events. Nonhuman animals do not use number names, such as \"one, two, three,\" or numerals, such as \"1, 2, 3\" to \"count\" in the same way as humans do. Our previous study established an animal model of counting in monkeys. Here, we used this model to determine whether the prefrontal cortex participates in counting in monkeys. Two 5-year-old female rhesus monkeys (macaques), weighing 5.0 kg and 5.5 kg, were selected to train in a counting task, counting from 1 to 5. When their counting task performance stabilized, we performed surgery on the prefrontal cortex to implant drug delivery tubes. After allowing the monkeys' physical condition and counting performance to recover, we injected either muscimol or normal saline into their dorsal and ventral prefrontal cortex. Thereafter, we observed their counting task performance and analyzed the error types and reaction time during the counting task. The monkeys' performance in the counting task decreased significantly after muscimol injection into the ventral prefrontal cortex; however, it was not affected after saline injection into the ventral prefrontal cortex, or after muscimol or saline injection into the dorsal prefrontal cortex. The ventral prefrontal cortex of the monkey is necessary for counting performance.\n",

Contrary to our hypothesis, perceived stress intensity and emotional arousal increased after SPB, and perceived emotional valence was less positive after SPB. This could be explained by experiencing dyspnea (i.e., breathing discomfort), and the need to get acclimatized to SPB.

            "In recent years, the clinical assessment of primary brain tumors has been increasingly dependent on advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in order to infer tumor pathophysiological characteristics, such as hemodynamics, metabolism, and microstructure. Quantitative radiomic data extracted from advanced MRI have risen as potential in vivo noninvasive biomarkers for predicting tumor grades and molecular subtypes, opening the era of \"molecular imaging\" and radiogenomics. This review presents the most relevant advancements in quantitative neuroimaging of advanced MRI techniques, by means of radiomics analysis, applied to primary brain tumors, including lower-grade glioma and glioblastoma, with a special focus on peculiar oncologic entities of current interest. Novel findings from diffusion MRI (dMRI), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), and MR spectroscopy (MRS) are hereby sifted in order to evaluate the role of quantitative imaging in neuro-oncology as a tool for predicting molecular profiles, stratifying prognosis, and characterizing tumor tissue microenvironments. Furthermore, innovative technological approaches are briefly addressed, including artificial intelligence contributions and ultra-high-field imaging new techniques. Lastly, after providing an overview of the advancements, we illustrate current clinical applications and future perspectives.\n",

            "The ambition of precision medicine is to design and optimize the pathway for diagnosis, therapeutic intervention, and prognosis by using large multidimensional biological datasets that capture individual variability in genes, function and environment. This offers clinicians the opportunity to more carefully tailor early interventions- whether treatment or preventative in nature-to each individual patient. Taking advantage of high performance computer capabilities, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can now achieve reasonable success in predicting risk in certain cancers and cardiovascular disease from available multidimensional clinical and biological data. In contrast, less progress has been made with the neurodevelopmental disorders, which include intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy and broader neurodevelopmental disorders. Much hope is pinned on the opportunity to quantify risk from patterns of genomic variation, including the functional characterization of genes and variants, but this ambition is confounded by phenotypic and etiologic heterogeneity, along with the rare and variable penetrant nature of the underlying risk variants identified so far. Structural and functional brain imaging and neuropsychological and neurophysiological markers may provide further dimensionality, but often require more development to achieve sensitivity for diagnosis. Herein, therefore, lies a precision medicine conundrum: can artificial intelligence offer a breakthrough in predicting risks and prognosis for neurodevelopmental disorders? In this review we will examine these complexities, and consider some of the strategies whereby artificial intelligence may overcome them.\n",

            "Controlled-rearing studies provide the unique opportunity to examine which psychological mechanisms are present at birth and which mechanisms emerge from experience. Here we show that one core component of visual perception-the ability to parse objects from backgrounds-is present when newborn animals see their first object. We reared newborn chicks in strictly controlled environments containing a single object on a single background, then tested the chicks' object parsing and recognition abilities. We found that chicks can parse objects from natural backgrounds at the onset of vision, allowing chicks to recognize objects equally well across familiar and novel backgrounds. We also found that the development of object parsing requires motion cues, akin to the development of object parsing in human infants and newly sighted blind patients. These results demonstrate that newborn brains are capable of \"one-shot object parsing\" and show that motion cues scaffold object perception from the earliest stages of learning. We conclude that prenatal developmental programs build brain architectures with an object-based inductive bias, allowing animals to solve object perception tasks immediately without extensive experience with objects. We discuss the implications of this finding for developmental psychology, computational neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).\n",

            "Clinicians working in the field of acquired brain injury (ABI, an injury to the brain sustained after birth) are challenged to develop suitable care pathways for an individual client's needs. Being able to predict psychosocial outcomes after ABI would enable clinicians and service providers to make advance decisions and better tailor care plans. Machine learning (ML, a predictive method from the field of artificial intelligence) is increasingly used for predicting ABI outcomes. This review aimed to examine the efficacy of using ML to make psychosocial predictions in ABI, evaluate the methodological quality of studies, and understand researchers' rationale for their choice of ML algorithms. Nine studies were reviewed from five databases, predicting a range of psychosocial outcomes from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and concussion. Eleven types of ML were employed with a total of 75 ML models. Every model was evaluated as having high risk of bias, unable to provide adequate evidence for predictive performance due to poor methodological quality. Overall, there was limited rationale for the choice of ML algorithms and poor evaluation of the methodological limitations by study authors. Considerations for overcoming methodological shortcomings are discussed, along with suggestions for assessing the suitability of data and suitability of ML algorithms for different ABI research questions.\n",

Speed in spoken language comprehension at early stages of language development requires information processing skills that may form the foundation for later language and school-relevant skills. In children born full-term, speed of comprehending words in an eye-tracking task at 2 years old predicted language and nonverbal cognition at 8 years old. Here, we explore the extent to which speed of language comprehension at 1.5 years old predicts both verbal and nonverbal outcomes at 4.5 years old in children born PT. METHOD: Participants were children born PT (n = 47; </=32 weeks gestation). Children were tested in the \"looking-while-listening\" task at 18 months old, adjusted for prematurity, to generate a measure of speed of language comprehension. Parent report and direct assessments of language were also administered. Children were later retested on a test battery of school-relevant skills at 4.5 years old. RESULTS: Speed of language comprehension at 18 months old predicted significant unique variance (12%-31%) in receptive vocabulary, global language abilities, and nonverbal intelligence quotient (IQ) at 4.5 years, controlling for socioeconomic status, gestational age, and medical complications of PT birth. Speed of language comprehension remained uniquely predictive (5%-12%) when also controlling for children's language skills at 18 months old. CONCLUSION: Individual differences in speed of spoken language comprehension may serve as a marker for neuropsychological processes that are critical for the development of school-relevant linguistic skills and nonverbal IQ in children born PT.\n",

            "The purpose of this study was to examine predictors of neurodevelopmental outcome in very low birth weight children without major impairment at 5 years of age, as well as to identify the contribution of early neurodevelopmental assessment to preterm children's later developmental outcomes. The participants in this study included 126 children who were prematurely born with very low birth weight. Outcomes of the childrens' later development were measured in tests that factored cognitive function, motor performance, and adaptive behavior. The results indicated that more than 50% of full-scale intelligence and 30% of both motor performance and adaptive behavior at the age of 5 can be explained by four predictors. The four predictors include preterm children's medical complications at birth, maternal education, early motor assessments, and cognitive assessments. Adding each test score obtained in early ages provides additional information to predict children's cognitive, motor, and adaptive behavior at 5 years of age. Manifold assessments conducted in multiple time periods strengthen the predictive values of later developmental outcomes. In addition, the findings of this study indicate that very low birth weight children tend to have lower adaptive behavior at 5 years old. With regard to our findings, we believe that having adaptive function is a reflection of a child's overall integrated abilities. Further study is warranted to increase understanding of this topic, as well as to be able to predict adaptive strengths and weakness and pinpoint limiting factors that may be useful for targeting behaviors in intervention.\n",

            "OBJECTIVE: Pathogenic variants in SCN1A can give rise to extremely variable disease severities that may be indistinguishable at their first presentation. We aim to find clinical features that can help predict the evolution of seizures into Dravet syndrome and clinical features that predict cognitive outcome in Dravet syndrome. We specifically investigate the role of contraindicated medication (CIM) as a possible modifier of cognitive decline. METHODS: A cohort of 164 Dutch participants with SCN1A-related seizures was evaluated. Clinical data were collected from medical records and semistructured telephone interviews. Cognitive function was classified by a child neurologist, neuropsychologist, and clinical geneticist. Several clinical variables, including duration of CIM use in the first 5 years of disease, were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A longer duration of CIM use in the first 5 years after seizure onset was significantly associated with a worse cognitive outcome at time of inclusion, and with lower interpolated intelligence quotient/developmental quotient scores after the first 5 years of disease in Dravet syndrome patients. CIM use remained a significant predictor for cognitive outcome in a multivariate regression model, as did age at the first observation of developmental delay and age at first afebrile seizure. Age at first afebrile seizure was the most accurate predictor for evolution of seizures into Dravet syndrome for the complete cohort. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that a longer CIM use in the first 5 years of disease can have negative effects on cognitive outcome in Dravet syndrome. An early diagnosis is essential to avoid these drugs. Furthermore, we identified age at first afebrile seizure as an important predictor for evolution of seizures into Dravet syndrome and for the severity of Dravet syndrome, which can be used to counsel parents of young patients with SCN1A-related seizures.\n",

Our objective was to prospectively analyze the neuropsychological features in a large cohort of DS patients and its relationships with epilepsy and SCN1A mutation. METHODS: 81 examinations were performed in 67 patients with typical DS (9m-24y, 15 longitudinally studied) using Brunet-Lezine (developmental/intelligence quotient [DQ/IQ] and DQ sub-scores), Achenbach, Conners, and a semi-quantitative psychomotor score (SQPS). We studied the correlation between DQ/IQ/SQPS and age, epilepsy characteristics, and whether patients presented SCN1A mutation. RESULTS: DQ/IQ significantly decreased with age (r = -.53, p < .001), from normal before 2y (mean 80, range 64-105) to low after 3y (mean 48, range 30-69), with hyperactivity and attention disorders hampering learning abilities especially up to 6y. However, raw (not age-adjusted) DQ sub-scores increased with age during the first decade, showing that there is no regression. We did not find any significant correlation between DQ/IQ at last evaluation and epilepsy data, i.e. first seizure (age, type, duration, fever), seizures during the course (type, fever sensitivity), status epilepticus (age of onset, number, fever), photosensitivity, and treatment, except for myoclonus and focal seizures which were associated with a lower QD/IQ after 3y. SCN1A mutated patients (n = 58) seemed to exhibit worse psychomotor course than non-mutated ones (n = 9) (severe SQPS in 26% vs 0%), although their epilepsy tended to be less severe (tonic seizures in 12% vs 44% [p = 0.04], first status epilepticus before 6 m in 26% vs 67% [p = .02], mean number of SE 2.5 vs 4.5 [p = .09]). DQ sub-scores were dissociated throughout the whole course: from onset hand-eye coordination was significantly lower than language, posture and sociability (p < .01). Dissociation seemed to be more frequent in mutated than in non-mutated patients (motor SQPS was normal for in 77% vs 44% [p = 0.017] whereas language SQPS was normal for 47% vs 100%). CONCLUSIONS: Although psychomotor/cognitive delay declines with age, there is no regression.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) are two typical forms of intractable epileptic encephalopathy associated with ID. We previously reported that ASD was diagnosed in 24.3% of patients with DS, higher in those with profound ID. Given the severe epilepsy and high frequency of ID in LGS, it is necessary to know whether ASD is a common psychomotor co-morbidity of LGS. This study evaluated the autistic behaviors and intelligence in patients with LGS and further compared that between LGS and DS, aiming to understand the complex pathogenesis of epilepsy-ASD-ID triad. METHODS: A total of 50 patients with LGS and 45 patients with DS were enrolled and followed up for at least 3 years. The clinical characteristics were analyzed, and evaluations of ASD and ID were performed. RESULTS: No patients with LGS fully met the diagnostic criteria for ASD, but three of them exhibited more or less autistic behaviors. Majority (86%) of LGS patients presented ID, among which moderate to severe ID was the most common. Early onset age and symptomatic etiology were risk predictors for ID. The prevalence of ASD in LGS was significantly lower than that in DS (0/50 vs. 10/45, p < 0.001), while the prevalence and severity of ID showed no significant difference between the two forms of epileptic encephalopathy. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a significant difference in the co-morbidity of ASD between LGS and DS, although they had a similar prevalence and severity of ID, refuting the proposal that the prevalence of ASD in epilepsy is accounted for by ID. These findings suggest that the co-morbidity of ASD, ID, and epilepsy may result from multifaceted pathogenic mechanisms.\n",

            "OBJECTIVE: Phenotypes caused by de novo SCN1A pathogenic variants are very variable, ranging from severely affected patients with Dravet syndrome to much milder genetic epilepsy febrile seizures plus cases. The most important determinant of disease severity is the type of variant, with variants that cause a complete loss of function of the SCN1A protein (alpha-subunit of the neuronal sodium channel Nav1.1) being detected almost exclusively in Dravet syndrome patients. However, even within Dravet syndrome disease severity ranges greatly, and consequently other disease modifiers must exist. A better prediction of disease severity is very much needed in daily practice to improve counseling, stressing the importance of identifying modifying factors in this patient group. We evaluated 128 participants with de novo, pathogenic SCN1A variants to investigate whether mosaicism, caused by postzygotic mutation, is a major modifier in SCN1A-related epilepsy. METHODS: Mosaicism was investigated by reanalysis of the pathogenic SCN1A variants using single molecule molecular inversion probes and next generation sequencing with high coverage. Allelic ratios of pathogenic variants were used to determine whether mosaicism was likely. Selected mosaic variants were confirmed by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction and sequencing of different tissues. Developmental outcome was classified based on available data on intelligence quotient and school functioning/education. RESULTS: Mosaicism was present for 7.5% of de novo pathogenic SCN1A variants in symptomatic patients. Mosaic participants were less severely affected than nonmosaic participants if only participants with truncating variants are considered (distribution of developmental outcome scores, Mann-Whitney U, P = .023). SIGNIFICANCE: Postzygotic mutation is a common phenomenon in SCN1A-related epilepsies. Participants with mosaicism have on average milder phenotypes, suggesting that mosaicism can be a major modifier of SCN1A-related diseases. Detection of mosaicism has important implications for genetic counseling and can be achieved by deep sequencing of unique reads.\n",

            "OBJECTIVE: To assess the neuroradiological findings of children with congenital hypothyroidism (CHT) compared to healthy controls (HC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty children with CHT, mean age 12.5 +/- 1.6 years, 14 (44.8%) males, were compared with 38 HC mean age 11.7 +/- 1.7 years, 16 (45.7%) males. Clinical data were collected from medical charts and questionnaires seeking information on family history, birth and perinatal period events, medications, and overall health history. Neurocognitive function was assessed for global intelligence, visual and verbal memory, and executive functioning using standardized tests. Neuroimaging was performed using 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging and assessed by two pediatric radiologists. RESULTS: Children with CHT had a similar proportion of incidental findings as did the children in the HC group, at 43.3% and 39.5%, respectively, P = 0.69. Abnormalities of the sellar region were reported in 13.3% of CHT group and 7.9% of HC group, P = 0.46. Other incidental findings included cerebellar ectopia, choroidal fissure and pineal cysts, and multiple increased signal intensity foci. Neuroradiological findings were not associated with clinical and neurocognitive abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Neuroimaging of children with CHT demonstrated a similar incidence of structural abnormalities as in the healthy population. There is no association between those findings and neurocognitive function.\n",

They are recognizable when it is too late for treatment or prevention. General screening of newborns is effective in diagnosing congenital hypothyroidism and initiating initial treatment. The aim of this study is to compare the physical and mental growth pattern of children with congenital hypothyroidism with healthy ones. METHODS: This case-control study was performed on 34 patients and 68 healthy children who were matched in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Children development screening test (ASQ), children development assessment test (Bayley), preschool Wechsler intelligence scale (WPPSI) and age and steps questionnaire of emotional social development (ASQ-SE) were completed by trained questioners. Data were analyzed using STATA software. RESULTS: The results indicated that there was no significant difference between the mean of verbal (P = 0.77), non-verbal (P = 0.81) and general (P = 0.66) IQ in permanent and transient patients and healthy individuals. Also, there was no significant difference between the mean of different ranges of ASQ test (including communication, delicate and large movements, problem solving and social) at 12 months and 42 months (P < 0.05). According to Bayley test, there was no significant difference between the cases (permanent and transient) and controls in the cognitive (P = 0.42) and expressive (P = 0.38) categories. The difference was significant in the perceptual (P = 0.011), large (P = 0.03) and delicate (P = 0.04) movements categories. CONCLUSION: This study emphasized on the high effectiveness of neonate hypothyroidism screening program, so that the difference between 3.5 years old children with and without this disease has decreased significantly. Early diagnosis of the patients, while creating beneficial effects for patients and increasing quality of life, cause reduction in the long-term costs of the health system.\n",

OBJECTIVE: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: The IQ scores, in three subsets of verbal, non verbal (Performance) and full scale IQ, of 240 children diagnosed with Transient congenital hypothyroidism (TCH) and Permanent congenital hypothyroidism (PCH), from 5 provinces in 5 different geographical areas of Iran, were measured at the age of 6 years using revised Wechsler pre school and primary scale of intelligence and compared with 240 healthy children. We used independent sample t test and two-way ANOVA for data analysis. RESULTS: Mean of verbal, performance, and full scale IQ scores were lower in the CH cases (permanent and transient) than the control group. Most of the IQ differences in two studied groups related to the PCH cases (P=0.005). Mean difference of IQs between children in the two groups in Yazd province (center of Iran) was higher than other provinces, and they also had significantly lower IQ than their control (healthy) children (P=0.001).

METHODS: This study was conducted among a group of 135 children aged 8--12 years in Isfahan, including transient and permanent congenital hypothyroidism (TCH and PCH) and a matched group of their classmate. Demographic characteristics collected using a designed data collecting form completed by parents. Intellectual quotient (IQ) was evaluated using Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children aged 6--16 years (WISC-III). Depression and anxiety were evaluated using The Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC), respectively. The SPSS software version 20.0 was used for data analysis. Nonparametric tests (Mann--Whitney) were used to investigate the association between variables. A significant level of less than 0.05 was considered in all analyzes. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the IQ scores between PCH and TCH groups (P = NS). However, neither of them had intellectual disability (defined as IQ <70). IQ scores were significantly lower in PCH comparing to controls (P < 0.001). Total IQ and verbal IQ were significantly differenct between TCH and control group (P = 0.007 and P = 0.001).

            "This study contributes to current knowledge on the protective role of emotional intelligence and flourishing in cases of suicide risk (namely depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation) in a sample of adolescent victims of traditional bullying. The proposed model tested the mediator role of flourishing in the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and suicide risk together with the moderating effect of EI in the relationship between low flourishing and increased suicide risk. Considering an initial sample of 1847 adolescents (52.5% female), a subsample of 494 pure bullying victims (61.3% female) took part in this research. The main results showed EI to be linked to decreased suicide risk through levels of flourishing. Moreover, EI buffered the relationship between low flourishing and the associated suicide risk. Victimized adolescents with both low levels of EI and of flourishing reported higher levels of suicide risk than their counterparts with high EI levels. This suggests the protective role of EI of both predicting higher flourishing and reducing the likelihood of suicide risk among victimized adolescents with low levels of flourishing. Finally, the practical implications of these novel findings regarding the role of EI and flourishing in the prevention of suicide risk among victimized adolescents are discussed.\n",

Little is known about the adaptive skills of adolescents with 22q11.2DS. AIM: To investigate adaptive functioning, intelligence and behavioural problems and their interrelationship in adolescents with 22q11.2DS. METHOD: We interviewed the parents of 37 adolescents with 22q11.2DS using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. We assessed the intelligence of the adolescents by means of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales. Parents, adolescents and teachers were required to complete the Achenbach behavioural questionnaire. RESULTS: We found that adolescents with 22q11.2DS had impaired adaptive skills; these skills were significantly more impaired than the adolescents' overall intelligence, i.e. their I.Q. Socialisation was a relatively well-developed domain compared to daily living skills. All respondents reported that the number of internalising problems exceeded the number of externalising problems. There was no correlation between adaptive functioning and behavioural problems, age or gender. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of adaptive skills in these adolescents is a first step on the road to the development of measures aimed at improving their functioning in society.\n",

AIMS: We aimed to assess sleep quality in children and adolescents with OCD and to seek its association with OCD symptoms and OCD severity. METHODS: All of the subjects were assessed using DSM 5 and affective disorders and schizophrenia for school-age children - present and lifetime version, which is based on DSM-IV. The Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale and children's Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale were applied to the subjects with OCD. Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) was used to assess sleep quality, and the Wechsler intelligence scale for children-revised (WISC-R) was used to measure their intelligence levels. RESULTS: PSQI total score was significantly higher in patients with OCD (p < 0.001), suggesting that patients with OCD have a significantly worse sleep quality. The presence of somatic disorders was also associated with worse sleep quality (p = 0.040). Sleep quality was not significantly associated with OCD severity (p = 0.152). Among patients with extreme OCD, the 'sleep duration' component of the PSQI was higher than those with moderate or severe OCD (p = 0.019). The patients with 'contamination/cleaning' symptom group had a lower total PSQI score compared with 'symmetry/hoarding' symptom group (p = 0.014).

It has been shown that low level of emotional intelligence (EI) might be related to a higher risk of self-injuries. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this association are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore whether psychopathological symptoms and selected psychological processes mediate the association between EI and self-harm risk in adolescents with conduct disorders. Method: Out of 162 adolescents with conduct disorder approached for participation, 136 individuals (aged 14.8 +/- 1.2 years, 56.6% females) were enrolled and completed the questionnaires evaluating the level of EI, depression, anxiety, impulsiveness, empathy, venturesomeness, self-esteem, and disgust. Results: Individuals with a lifetime history of self-injuries had significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety and impulsivity as well as significantly lower levels of EI and self-esteem. Higher levels of EI were associated with significantly higher levels of self-esteem, venturesomeness and empathy as well as significantly lower levels of depression, anxiety and impulsivity. Further analysis revealed that trait and state anxiety as well as self-esteem were complete mediators of the association between EI and self-harm risk. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that anxiety and self-esteem might mediate the association between EI and a risk of self-injuries in adolescents with conduct disorder.

Yet, little is known about them in the largest group of treatment seekers today, individuals with polysubstance use disorders (PSU). This study primarily contrasted PSU and individuals with an alcohol use disorder (AUD) on neurocognitive and inhibitory control measures and, secondarily, measured changes during abstinence in PSU. METHOD: At one month of abstinence from all substances except tobacco, 36 PSU and 69 AUD completed neurocognitive assessments of executive function, general intelligence, auditory-verbal learning/memory, visuospatial learning/memory/skills, processing speed, working memory, fine motor skills, and cognitive efficiency. The groups were also assessed on inhibitory control measures of self-reported impulsivity, risk-taking, and decision-making. Seventeen PSU repeated the assessments after approximately four months of abstinence. All cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses included smoking status as a possible confound. RESULTS: At baseline, PSU performed significantly worse than AUD on auditory-verbal memory and on an inhibitory control measure of impulsivity. Polysubstance users showed trends to worse performance than AUD on general intelligence, auditory-verbal learning, and a decision-making task. Between one and four months of abstinence, PSU showed significant improvements on several neurocognitive and inhibitory control measures. CONCLUSIONS: Polysubstance users exhibit distinct differences in neurocognition and inhibitory control compared to AUD. Between one and four months of abstinence, neurocognition and inhibitory control improve in PSU. This neurocognitive recovery in some domains of abstinent PSU is influenced by smoking status. These results underscore the clinical value of select methods to augment neurocognitive recovery in PSU through appropriate interventions.\n",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study eyes of 270 treatment-naive subjects, randomized to receiving ranibizumab therapy in the T&E arm of a randomized clinical trial were considered. OCT volume scans were processed at baseline and at the first follow-up visit 4 weeks later. Automated image segmentation was performed, where intraretinal (IRF), subretinal (SRF) fluid, pigment epithelial detachment (PED), hyperreflective foci, and the photoreceptor layer were delineated using a convolutional neural network (CNN). A set of respective quantitative imaging biomarkers were computed across an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grid to describe the retinal pathomorphology spatially and its change after the first injection. Lastly, using the computed set of OCT features and available clinical and demographic information, predictive models of outcomes and retreatment intervals were built using machine learning and their performance evaluated with a 10-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: Data of 228 evaluable patients were included, as some had missing scans or were lost to follow-up. Of those patients, 55% reached and maintained long (8, 10, 12 weeks) and another 45% stayed at short (4, 6 weeks) treatment intervals. This provides further evidence for a high disease activity in a major proportion of patients. The model predicted the extendable treatment interval group with an AUROC of 0.71, and the visual outcome with an AUROC of up to 0.87 when utilizing both, clinical and imaging features. The volume of SRF and the volume of IRF, remaining at the first follow-up visit, were found to be the most important predictive markers for treatment intervals and visual outcomes, respectively, supporting the important role of quantitative fluid parameters on OCT. CONCLUSION: The proposed Artificial intelligence (AI) methodology was able to predict visual outcomes and retreatment intervals of a T&E regimen from a single injection. The result of this study is an urgently needed step toward AI-supported management of patients with active and progressive nAMD.\n",

In the current study, we translated and adapted an existing social cognitive skills training (SCST) program into Arabic and conducted a preliminary efficacy evaluation in schizophrenia outpatients in Egypt. Twenty-two patients were randomized to 16 sessions of group-based SCST and 20 were randomized to a format- and time-matched illness management training control condition. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included a primary social cognition outcome measure that assessed four branches of emotional intelligence and a battery of neurocognitive tests. The SCST group demonstrated significant treatment effects on total emotional intelligence scores (F=24.31, p<.001), as well as the sub-areas of Identifying Emotions (F=11.77, p<.001) and Managing Emotions (F=23.27, p<.001), compared with those in the control condition. There were no treatment benefits for neurocognition for either condition, and both interventions were well-tolerated by patients.

            "INTRODUCTION: The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is caused by hemizygous microdeletions on chromosome 22. 22q11.2DS has several presentations including Di George's syndrome, velo-cardio-facial syndrome or Shprintzen's syndrome and it is the most frequent microdeletion syndrome in the general population (prevalence estimated at 1/4000 births, de novo: 90%). The inheritance of the syndrome (10%) is autosomal dominant. Most people with 22q11.2DS are missing a sequence of about 3 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) on one copy of chromosome 22 in each cell. A small percentage of affected individuals have shorter deletions in the same region (contiguous gene deletion syndrome). The general features of 22q11.2DS vary widely (more than 180 phenotypic presentations) and the syndrome is under diagnosed. Characteristic symptoms may include congenital heart disease, defects in the palate, neuromuscular problems, velo-pharyngeal insufficiency, hypoparathyroidism, craniofacial features and problems with the immune system T-cell mediated response (caused by hypoplasia of the thymus). COGNITIVE PHENOTYPE: The neurocognitive phenotype of the 22q11.2DS is complex. Cognitive deficits are seen in the majority (80-100%) of individuals with 22q11DS with impairments in sustained attention, executive function, memory and visual-spatial perception. Borderline intellectual function (IQ: 70-75) is most common, mild intellectual disability (IQ: 55-75) is slightly less frequent and a small percentage of children fall into the low average intelligence range. Most children with 22q11.2DS achieve higher scores in verbal tasks than in non-verbal tasks, although this pattern of dysfunction being not universal. Brain MRI studies have shown volumetric changes in multiple cortical and subcortical regions in individuals with 22q11DS that could be related to both cognition and psychoses. PSYCHIATRIC PHENOTYPE: General psychiatric features included anxiety disorders, attention deficit disorder and poor social skills (40-50%). An elevated risk of bipolar disorder and major depression occurs in adolescence and young adulthood. A strong and specific relationship exists between the presence of the 22q11.2 microdeletion and schizophrenia (30-40%). This risk is not associated with any other neurogenetic syndrome. Social cognition is impaired in 22q11.2 DS and this observation is correlated with psychotic features. So, long-term medical care is increasingly being directed towards the treatment and recognition of these symptoms. TREATMENT: Required pharmacological treatment strategies have to be adapted to the syndrome. Moreover, cognitive remediation is a promising tool for treating neuro- and social cognitive deficits in 22q11.2DS. However, these new therapeutic strategies have to be developed to improve quality of life.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Decline in cognitive functioning precedes the first psychotic episode in the course of schizophrenia and is considered a hallmark symptom of the disorder. Given the low incidence of schizophrenia, it remains a challenge to investigate whether cognitive decline coincides with disease-related changes in brain structure, such as white matter abnormalities. The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is an appealing model in this context,\n",

            "22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is one of the most common recurrent copy-number variant disorder, caused by a microdeletion in chromosome band 22q11.2 and occurring with a population prevalence of 1 in 2000. Until today there has been no evidence that the size of the deletion has an influence on the clinical phenotype. Most studies report that 22q11DS is associated with mild or borderline intellectual disability. There are a limited number of reports on 22q11DS subjects with moderate or severe intellectual disability. In this study we describe 63 adult patients with 22q11DS, including 22q11DS patients functioning at a moderate to severe intellectual disabled level. Deletion size was established with an experimental Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) mixture (P324) in addition to the commonly used MLPA kit (P250). We compared deletion size with intellectual functioning and presence of psychotic symptoms during life. The use of the experimental MLPA kit gives extra information on deletion size, only when combined with the common MLPA kit. We were able to detect eleven atypical deletions and in two cases the deletion size was shorter than all other \"typical ones\". We conclude that the use of the experimental kit P324 gives extra information about the deletion size, but only when used together with the standard P250 kit. We did not found any relation of deletion size with intelligence or presence of psychosis.\n",

The authors report what is to their knowledge the first large-scale collaborative study of rates and sex distributions of psychiatric disorders from childhood to adulthood in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. The associations among psychopathology, intellect, and functioning were examined in a subgroup of participants. METHOD: The 1,402 participants with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, ages 6-68 years, were assessed for psychiatric disorders with validated diagnostic instruments. Data on intelligence and adaptive functioning were available for 183 participants ages 6 to 24 years. RESULTS: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was the most frequent disorder in children (37.10%) and was overrepresented in males. Anxiety disorders were more prevalent than mood disorders at all ages, but especially in children and adolescents. Anxiety and unipolar mood disorders were overrepresented in females. Psychotic disorders were present in 41% of adults over age 25. Males did not predominate in psychotic or autism spectrum disorders. Hierarchical regressions in the subgroup revealed that daily living skills were predicted by the presence of anxiety disorders. Psychopathology was not associated with communication or socialization skills. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the largest study of psychiatric morbidity in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. It validates previous findings that this condition is one of the strongest risk factors for psychosis. Anxiety and developmental disorders were also prevalent. These results highlight the need to monitor and reduce the long-term burden of psychopathology in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.\n",

Thus, we aimed to characterize the profile of attention difficulties in children with epilepsy. METHODS: Seventy-five children with localization-related epilepsy ages 6-16 years and 75 age-matched controls were evaluated using multimodal, multidimensional measures of attention including direct performance and parent ratings of attention as well as intelligence testing. We assessed group differences across attention measures, determined if parent rating predicted performance on attention measures, and examined if epilepsy characteristics were associated with attention skills. RESULTS: The EPI group performed worse than the TD group on timed and complex attention aspects of attention (p < 0.05), whereas performance on simple visual and simple auditory attention tasks was comparable. Children with EPI were 12 times as likely as TD children to have clinically elevated symptoms of inattention as rated by parents, but ratings were a weak predictor of attention performance. Earlier age of onset was associated with slower motor speed (p < 0.01), but no other epilepsy-related clinical characteristics were associated with attention skills. SIGNIFICANCE: This study clarifies the nature of the attention problems in pediatric epilepsy, which may be under-recognized. Children with EPI had difficulty with complex attention and rapid response, not simple attention. As such, they may not exhibit difficulty until later in primary school when demands increase. Parent report with standard ADHD screening tools may under-detect these higher-order attention difficulties. Thus, monitoring through direct neuropsychological performance is recommended.\n",

The aims of this study were to investigate the structural networks in children with localization-related epilepsy and to assess the relation among structural connectivity, intelligence quotient, and clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five children with nonlesional localization-related epilepsy and 28 healthy controls underwent DTI. Global network (network strength, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, global efficiency, and small-world parameters), regional network (nodal efficiency), and the network-based statistic were compared between patients and controls and correlated with intelligence quotient and clinical parameters. RESULTS: Patients showed disrupted global network connectivity relative to controls, including reduced network strength, increased characteristic path length and reduced global efficiency, and reduced nodal efficiency in the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Connectivity in multiple subnetworks was reduced in patients, including the frontal-temporal, insula-temporal, temporal-temporal, frontal-occipital, and temporal-occipital lobes. The frontal lobe epilepsy subgroup demonstrated more areas with reduced nodal efficiency and more impaired subnetworks than the temporal lobe epilepsy subgroup. Network parameters were not significantly associated with intelligence quotient, age at seizure onset, or duration of epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: We found disruption in global and regional networks and subnetworks in children with localization-related epilepsy. Regional efficiency and subnetworks were more impaired in frontal lobe epilepsy than in temporal lobe epilepsy. Future studies are needed to evaluate the implications of disrupted networks for surgical resection and outcomes for specific epileptogenic zones and the relation of disrupted networks to more complex cognitive function.\n",

METHODS: A total of 15 treatment naive children (7-15 years) with recently diagnosed NT1 were recruited from three sleep medicine centers in the Netherlands. The control group consisted of 15 healthy children, being frequency matched on age and gender. Both groups were investigated at baseline to examine intelligence profile (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children [WISC] III), attention problems, and processing speed (Bourdon Vos and sustained attention to respond task [SART]). These tests were repeated in children with NT1 1 year after regular (behavioral and medication) treatment for NT1. RESULTS: Children with NT1 scored significantly lower on the verbal scale and processing speed subscale of the WISC III, showed more fluctuations in reaction time of the Bourdon Vos and made more mistakes during the SART than the healthy control group at baseline. Children with NT1 significantly improved on total IQ score, and on the WISC indices processing speed, and perceptual organization 1 year after treatment. At follow-up, test scores of treated children were largely comparable to those of the control group at baseline.

            "Several studies suggest impaired executive functions (EFs) in children with externalizing behavior problems and average intelligence (e.g., IQ > 85). Even though children with mild to borderline intellectual disabilities (MBID) are at higher risk of developing externalizing behavior problems compared to children with average intelligence, it is not yet clear if impaired EFs are also associated with the occurrence of externalizing behavior problems in children with MBID. In the current study, we therefore assessed three EF components (inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and working memory) as well as processing speed in children with MBID and externalizing behavior problems (n = 71) versus children with MBID with no such problems (n = 70). This was accomplished using a well-established computerized test battery. Even after IQ was controlled for, the children with MBID and externalizing behavior problems showed more impaired working memory performance. Differences for inhibition performance and processing speed were also found but less consistent across the tasks used to measure these aspects of EF. Cognitive flexibility was not more impaired in children with both MBID and externalizing behavior problems relative to children with MBID only.

Abnormal physical signs such as dystopia canthorum, patchy hypopigmentation and sensorineural hearing loss are common, but short stature is not associated with WS1. CASE PRESENTATION: We reported a 4-year and 6 month-old boy with a rare combination of WS1 and severe short stature (83.5 cm (-5.8SD)). His facial features include dystopia canthorum, mild synophrys, slightly up-slanted palpebral fissure, posteriorly rotated ears, alae nasi hypoplasia and micrognathia. No heterochromia was noticed. He had a normal intelligence quotient and hearing. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was 52.7 ng/ml, lower than the normal range (55 ~ 452 ng/ml) and the peak growth hormone level was 7.57 ng/ml at 90 minutes after taking moderate levodopa and pyridostigmine bromide. The patient exhibited a good response to human growth hormone (rhGH) replacement therapy, showing a 9.2 cm/year growth rate and an improvement of 1 standard deviation (SD) of height after one year treatment. CMA test of patient's DNA revealed a 4.46 Mb de novo deletion at 2q35-q36.2 (hg19; chr2:221,234,146-225,697,363). CONCLUSIONS: PAX3 haploinsufficiency is known to cause Waardenburg syndrome. Examining overlapping deletions in patients led to the conclusion that EPHA4 is a novel short stature gene. The finding is supported by the splotch-retarded and epha4 knockout mouse models which both showed growth retardation. We believe this rare condition is caused by the haploinsufficiency of both PAX3 and EPH4 genes. We further reported a growth response to recombinant human growth hormone treatment in this patient.\n",

We conclude that the haploinsufficience of SHOX may be the cause of short stature and skeletal defects in the patient, while the non-obstructive azoospermia could be related to the lack of X-Y pairing during meiosis originated by the anomalous configuration of this chromosome abnormality and large deletion which occurred in Yp-PAR1.\n",

            "INTRODUCTION: Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) represent the primary cause of chronic kidney disease in children. Many genes have been attributed to the genesis of this disorder. Recently, haploinsufficiency of PBX1 caused by microdeletions has been shown to result in bilateral renal hypoplasia and other organ malformations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we report on a 14-year-old male patient with congenital bilateral dysplastic kidneys, cryptorchidism, hypoplastic clavicles, developmental delay, impaired intelligence, and minor dysmorphic features. Presuming a syndromic origin, we performed SNP array analysis to scan for large copy number variations (CNVs) followed by whole-exome sequencing (WES). Sanger sequencing was done to confirm the variant's de novo status. RESULTS: SNP array analysis did not reveal any microdeletions or -duplications larger than 50 or 100 kb, respectively. WES identified a novel heterozygous 7-bp frameshift deletion in PBX1 (c.413_419del, p.Gly138Valfs*40) resulting in a loss-of-function. The de novo status could be confirmed by Sanger sequencing. DISCUSSION: By WES, we identified a novel heterozygous de novo 7-bp frameshift deletion in PBX1. Our findings expand the spectrum of causative variants in PBX1-related CAKUT. In this case, WES proved to be the apt technique to detect the variant responsible for the patient's phenotype, as single gene testing is not feasible given the multitude of genes involved in CAKUT and SNP array analysis misses rare single-nucleotide variants and small Indels.\n",

Most studies focused on neurobehavioural sequelae, less data is reported about age appropriate function. Different prognostic factors were noted over past decades. METHODS: A prospective historical study describing the functional long-term outcome after childhood moderate and severe TBI was conducted. Seventy-seven children who suffered either severe or moderate TBI were followed for an average of ten years and clinical functional outcome was recorded. Factors influencing prognosis were investigated. RESULTS: All children but six were integrated into educational systems after discharge from rehabilitation settings (department and day-care); 61% of children who suffered severe-moderate TBI were able to function within their normative age peers. Positive outcome predictors were Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) >5, length of unconsciousness (LOC) <11 days, Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) at discharge from rehabilitation, length of acute hospitalization and rehabilitation. Negative outcome predictors were vegetative state at admission to rehabilitation and associated anoxic brain injury.

To answer this question, the authors compared the neuropsychological profile of late school-age children/adolescents and young adult patients at mid- and long-term recovery periods (6 and 12 months post-STBI). METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Twenty-eight children/adolescents and 26 clinically matched adults were tested on measures of general intelligence, attention, executive functions, visuoperceptual, visuospatial and visuoconstructive abilities. Coma duration and the post-acute Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score were used as predictor variables in a series of regression analyses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Children/adolescents and adults similarly improved on most measures, except for visuospatial and visuoconstructive skills, which worsened in time for children/adolescents. Coma duration significantly predicted performance IQ and visuoperceptual scores in children/adolescents. The GOS score significantly predicted performance and verbal IQ, sustained attention, visuoconstructive and long-term memory skills. Coma duration predicted executive function skills in both age groups. CONCLUSIONS: (1) No evidence was found for a neuroprotective effect of younger age at STBI; and (2) Coma duration and GOS score predicted neuropsychological recovery in children/adolescents and adults, respectively. This suggests the existence of underlying age-specific recovery processes after STBI.\n",

Methods. DSRELs (n = 15) and non-DSRELs (n = 40) were compared with community controls (CCs, n = 55) on executive functioning measured by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and the phonemic verbal fluency (PVF), and clinical measures. Effects of psychopathology and intelligence quotient (IQ) measures were investigated to determine their association with executive performance. Results. DSRELs showed more executive dysfunction on WCST and poorer social functioning than CCs and more severe negative symptoms than non-DSRELs. Differences on WCST-categories achieved (WCST-CA) remained significant after adjustment for clinical confounders and IQ. WCST-CA was associated with apathy and paranoid ideation only within the DSREL subgroup. Conclusions.

            "BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, coronary artery disease) and stroke can lead to vascular cognitive impairment. The Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis and Cognitive Function study evaluated the isolated impact of asymptomatic carotid stenosis (no prior ipsilateral or contralateral stroke or transient ischemic attack) on cognitive function. Cerebrovascular hemodynamic and carotid plaque characteristics were analyzed to elucidate potential mechanisms affecting cognition. METHODS: There were 82 patients with >/=50% asymptomatic carotid stenosis and 62 controls without stenosis but matched for vascular comorbidities who underwent neurologic, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and comprehensive neuropsychological examination. Overall cognitive function and five domain-specific scores were computed. Duplex ultrasound with Doppler waveform and B-mode imaging defined the degree of stenosis, least luminal diameter, plaque area, and plaque gray-scale median. Breath-holding index (BHI) and microembolization were measured using transcranial Doppler. We assessed cognitive differences between stenosis patients and control patients and of stenosis patients with low vs high BHI and correlated cognitive function with microembolic counts and plaque characteristics. RESULTS: Stenosis and control patients did not differ in vascular risk factors, education, estimated intelligence, or depressive symptoms. Stenosis patients had worse composite cognitive scores (P = .02; Cohen's d = 0.43) and domain-specific scores for learning/memory (P = .02; d = 0.42) and motor/processing speed (P = .01; d = 0.65), whereas scores for executive function were numerically lower (P = .08). Approximately 49.4% of all stenosis patients were impaired in at least two cognitive domains. Precisely 50% of stenosis patients demonstrated a reduced BHI. Stenosis patients with reduced BHI performed worse on the overall composite cognitive score (t = -2.1; P = .02; d = 0.53) and tests for learning/memory (t = -2.7; P = .01; d = 0.66). Cognitive function did not correlate with measures of plaque burden (degree of stenosis, least luminal diameter, and plaque area) or with plaque gray-scale median. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic carotid stenosis is associated with cognitive impairment independent of known vascular risk factors for vascular cognitive impairment. Approximately 49.4% of these patients demonstrate impairment in at least two neuropsychological domains. The deficit is driven primarily by reduced motor/processing speed and learning/memory and is mild to moderate in severity. The mechanism for impairment is likely to be hemodynamic as evidenced by reduced cerebrovascular reserve and the likely result of hypoperfusion from a pressure drop across the stenosis in the presence of inadequate collateralization.\n",

In order to improve empathy in the veterinary field, it is critical to measure the construct of empathy accurately. Most research has relied on self-reporting measures to assess empathy, while some studies have recently implemented the use of simulated client encounters in veterinary education. Building on this research, the aim of the current study was to develop and validate a novel quantitative assessment tool-the Empathy Clinical Evaluation Exercise (ECEX)-designed to measure empathy based on directly observable behaviors, using simulated clients. To evaluate empathy, evaluators used the ECEX to assess the performance of student clinicians in a simulated client encounter, which contained a pre-determined number of opportunities designed to elicit empathic responses from student clinicians. Statistical analysis suggests the test has a high degree of inter-rater reliability. In addition, there was moderate correlation between average empathy scores using ECEX and previously validated measures of empathy, compassion satisfaction, and burnout. Using these methods, we found the majority of students we studied had increased empathy scores at the completion of their primary care rotations. These results provide preliminary support for the use of the ECEX as a direct and quantitative tool for the assessment of empathy. Health professionals could use this novel empathy assessment tool to teach students, evaluate teaching strategies, and improve communication competencies in a wide variety of clinical settings. Our broad aim was to examine the utility of a direct and quantitative assessment tool for measuring empathy-the ECEX-in order to answer the following questions: (1) Does the tool have good inter-rater reliability? (2) Does the tool correlate with previously validated empathy measures? and (3) Does the tool correlate with similar constructs of compassion fatigue and burnout?

            "PURPOSE: Our purpose was to explore the relationship between cognitive impairment and neural network changes in patients newly diagnosed with self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SeLECTS). METHODS: The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, fourth edition was used to divide all SeLECTS patients into two groups: patients with full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) below 80 that corresponded to cognitive impairment, and patients with FSIQ above 80 that corresponded to a normal cognitive function. The data on the resting state were recorded using magnetoencephalography. The properties of the networks were analyzed using graph theory (GT) analysis. RESULTS: The functional connectivity (FC) of the frontal cortex in patients with FSIQ < 80 was reduced in the 12-30 Hz frequency band, and the FC of the posterior cingulate cortex was reduced in the 80-250 and 250-500 Hz frequency bands. The GT analysis showed that patients in the FSIQ < 80 group had higher strength in the 8-12 and 12-30 Hz frequency bands than those in the healthy control and FSIQ > 80 group. However, the path length was reduced in the 80-250 Hz band, and the clustering coefficient was reduced in the 12-30, 80-250, and 250-500 Hz frequency bands. Moreover, the receiver operator characteristic analysis showed that the clustering coefficient in the 12-30 and 80-250 Hz frequency bands, as well as the path length in the 80-250 Hz frequency band possessed a good discriminative ability in distinguishing the FSIQ > 80 group. CONCLUSIONS: SeLECTS patients with cognitive impairment in the early stage of the disease developed disordered networks in cognitive-related brain regions. The clustering coefficient in the 12-30 and 80-250 Hz frequency bands as well as the path length in the 80-250 Hz frequency band might be good indicators to distinguish the cognitive impairment of SeLECTS patients at the early stage.\n",

METHODS: We assessed 554 community-dwelling subjects (male/female: 296/258) from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and carotid Doppler ultrasound studies at age 73 years. The relationship between carotid atherosclerosis markers (internal carotid artery stenosis, intima-media thickness, velocity, pulsatility, and resistivity indexes) and vertex-wide cerebral cortical thickness was examined cross-sectionally, controlling for gender, extensive vascular risk factors (VRFs), and intelligence quotient at age 11 (IQ-11). We also determined the association between carotid stenosis and a composite measure of fluid intelligence at age 73 years. A mediation model was applied to examine whether cortical thickness mediated the relationship between carotid stenosis and cognitive function. RESULTS: A widespread negative association was identified between carotid stenosis (median = 15%) and cerebral cortical thickness at age 73 years, independent of the side of carotid stenosis, other carotid measures, VRFs, and IQ-11. This association increased in an almost dose-response relationship from mild to severe degrees of carotid stenosis, across the anterior and posterior circulation territories. A negative association was also noted between carotid stenosis and fluid intelligence (standardized beta coefficient = -0.151, p = 0.001), which appeared partly (approximately 22%) mediated by carotid stenosis-related thinning of the cerebral cortex. INTERPRETATION: The findings suggest that carotid stenosis represents a marker of processes that accelerate aging of the cerebral cortex and cognition that is in part independent of measurable VRFs. Cortical thinning within the anterior and posterior circulation territories partially mediated the relationship between carotid atheroma and fluid intelligence. Ann Neurol 2018;84:576-587.\n",

            "Background: It was difficult to distinguish the cartilage thinning of an entire knee joint and to track the evolution of cartilage morphology alongside ages in the general population, which was of great significance for studying osteoarthritis until big imaging data and artificial intelligence are fused. The purposes of our study are (1) to explore the cartilage thickness in anatomical regions of the knee joint among a large collection of healthy knees, and (2) to investigate the relationship between the thinning pattern of the cartilages and the increasing ages. Methods: In this retrospective study, 2,481 healthy knees (subjects ranging from 15 to 64 years old, mean age: 35 +/- 10 years) were recruited. With magnetic resonance images of knees acquired on a 3-T superconducting scanner, we automatically and precisely segmented the cartilage via deep learning and calculated the cartilage thickness in 14 anatomical regions. The thickness readings were compared using ANOVA by considering the factors of age, sex, and side. We further tracked the relationship between the thinning pattern of the cartilage thickness and the increasing ages by regression analysis. Results: The cartilage thickness was always thicker in the femur than corresponding regions in the tibia (p < 0.05). Regression analysis suggested cartilage thinning alongside ages in all regions (p < 0.05) except for medial and lateral anterior tibia in both females and males (p > 0.05). The thinning speed of men was faster than women in medial anterior and lateral anterior femur, yet slower in the medial patella (p < 0.05). Conclusion: We established the calculation method of cartilage thickness using big data and deep learning. We demonstrated that cartilage thickness differed across individual regions in the knee joint. Cartilage thinning alongside ages was identified, and the thinning pattern was consistent in the tibia while inconsistent in patellar and femoral between sexes. These findings provide a potential reference to detect cartilage anomaly.\n",

            "AIM: To investigate different proxies of brain and cognitive reserve as potential mediators of the effect of cortical thinning on cognition in healthy middle-aged adults. METHODS: Eighty-two middle-aged individuals were included (mean(SD) age=45.1(3.9)years). Cortical thickness was calculated for multiple brain regions using FreeSurfer. Cognitive measures sensitive to early cognitive decline were selected, including Block Design from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), Judgment of Line Orientation Test (JLOT), Color Trails Test (CTT), and first learning trial of TAVEC (the Spanish version of the California Verbal Learning Test, CVLT). Brain reserve was operationalized as total intracranial volume (TIV); and cognitive reserve was estimated by means of Years of Education, WAIS-III Vocabulary subtest, WAIS-III Information subtest, and a Cognitive Reserve Questionnaire (CRQ). Mediation effects were investigated with multiple linear regression and bootstrapping analysis. RESULTS: Information and Vocabulary showed the greatest mediation capacity. All the observed mediations were positive indicating that higher levels of reserve attenuate the effect of reduced cortical thickness on cognition. Information, Vocabulary and TIV buffered the effect of frontal thinning on Block Design; Vocabulary and Years of Education buffered the effect of frontal thinning on JLOT; and CRQ buffered the effect of temporal thinning on CTT. CONCLUSION: Higher reserve buffers the effect of cortical thinning on cognition in healthy middle-aged adults. The investigated proxies might be underpinned by slightly different neural networks. Advancing in the understanding of the influences of reserve in healthy middle-aged adults is crucial to facilitate early interventions.\n",

Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that verbal and non-verbal intelligence can be dissociated and focal cortical regions corresponding to each have been demonstrated. However, the pattern of structural covariance corresponding to verbal and non-verbal intelligence remains unexplored. In this study, we used 586 longitudinal anatomical MRI scans of subjects aged 6-18 years, who had concurrent intelligence quotient (IQ) testing on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. Structural covariance networks (SCNs) were constructed using interregional correlations in cortical thickness for low-IQ (Performance IQ=100+/-8, Verbal IQ=100+/-7) and high-IQ (PIQ=121+/-8, VIQ=120+/-9) groups. From low- to high-VIQ group, we observed constrained patterns of anatomical coupling among cortical regions, complemented by observations of higher global efficiency and modularity, and lower local efficiency in high-VIQ group, suggesting a shift towards a more optimal topological organization. Analysis of nodal topological properties (regional efficiency and participation coefficient) revealed greater involvement of left-hemispheric language related regions including inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri for high-VIQ group. From low- to high-PIQ group, we did not observe significant differences in anatomical coupling patterns, global and nodal topological properties. Our findings indicate that people with higher verbal intelligence have structural brain differences from people with lower verbal intelligence - not only in localized cortical regions, but also in the patterns of anatomical coupling among widely distributed cortical regions, possibly resulting to a system-level reorganization that might lead to a more efficient organization in high-VIQ group.\n",

            "OBJECTIVE: Intelligence quotient (IQ) outcomes after pediatric epilepsy surgery show significant individual variation. Clinical factors such as seizure cessation or antiepileptic medication discontinuation have been implicated, but do not fully account for the heterogeneity seen. Less is known about the impact of neurobiological factors, such as brain development and resection location. This study examines clinical and neuroimaging factors associated with cognitive outcome after epilepsy surgery in childhood. METHODS: Fifty-two children (28 boys, 24 girls) were evaluated for epilepsy surgery and reassessed on average 7.7 years later. In the intervening time, 13 were treated pharmacologically and 39 underwent focal surgery (17 temporal, 16 extratemporal, six multilobar; mean age at surgery = 14.0 years). Pre- and postsurgical assessments included IQ tests and T1-weighted brain images. Predictors of IQ change were investigated, including voxel-based analyses of resection location, and gray and white matter volume change. RESULTS: Overall modest IQ improvement was seen in children treated surgically, but not in those treated pharmacologically only. Applying a >/=10-point change threshold, 39% of the surgically treated children improved, whereas 10% declined. Clinical factors associated with IQ increases were lower preoperative IQ and longer follow-up duration, whereas seizure and antiepileptic medication cessation were not predictive. Among neuroimaging factors, we observed that left anterior temporal resections impacted negatively on verbal reasoning, linked to full-scale IQ decline. In contrast, gray matter volume change in ipsi- and contralesional hemispheres was positively correlated with IQ change. Voxel-based morphometry identified the gray matter volume change in the contralesional dorsolateral frontal cortex as most strongly associated with IQ improvement. SIGNIFICANCE: We show that a variety of factors are likely to contribute to patterns of postsurgical change in IQ. Neuroimaging results indicate that left anterior temporal resections constrain development of verbal cognition, whereas simultaneously cortical growth after surgical treatment can support improvements in IQ.\n",

METHODS: Eighteen carefully selected patients with bilateral TLE underwent unilateral ATL. Five cases with failed ATL underwent two-staged contralateral hippocampal stimulation. Seizure control and changes in intelligence quotient (IQ), memory quotient, and quality of life (QOL) were analyzed 2-5 years after treatment. RESULTS: In the patients with unilateral ATL, the percentages seizure free were 55.6% (10/18), 50.0% (9/18), and 44.4% (4/9) at the 1-, 2-, and 5-year follow-up visits, respectively. There were significant difference in seizure control between the patients with unilateral ATL and the 12 cases in the medication group. Significant differences were also found in changes in the patients' QOL and full-scale IQ at the 2-year follow-up between the surgical and medication groups. Five patients who underwent contralateral hippocampal stimulation after failed unilateral ATL experienced 80-100% seizure reductions, and 80% were seizure free 1 year after hippocampal stimulation.

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant studies published between January 1990 and September 2012. Studies comparing SelAH and ATL with respect to seizure and intelligence outcomes were included. Two reviewers assessed the quality of the included studies and independently extracted the data. Odds ratios and standardized mean deviations with 95% confidence intervals were used to compare pooled proportions of freedom from seizures and changes in IQ scores between the SelAH and ATL groups. RESULTS: Three prospective and 10 retrospective studies were identified involving 745 and 766 patients who underwent SelAH and ATL, respectively. The meta-analysis demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the odds of seizure freedom for patients who underwent SelAH compared with those who underwent ATL (OR 0.65 [95% CI 0.51-0.82], p = 0.0005). The differences between the changes in all IQ scores after the 2 types of surgery were not statistically significant, regardless of the side of resection.

METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in patients with chronic medically intractable MTLE undergoing anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) or selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SAH) in our department between September, 2011 and October, 2013. The patients were followed up for 3.5 to 5.5 years, during which the seizure outcome was evaluated according to Engel's classification. The clinical data were collected from the patients to identify the possible predictors that affected the outcome of the patients using Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: Atotal of 34 patients were included in this study with a definite diagnosis of chronic medically intractable MTLE after preoperative noninvasive and invasive evaluation. In 4 of these patients, invasive EEG monitoring confirmed that epileptic discharges originated from the bilateral mesial temporal lobe, and hence surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone was not performed. The other 30 patients underwent surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone with ALT or SAH, and favorable outcomes were achieved in 23 (76.7%) of the patients. Of the 7 (23.3%) patients with poor outcomes, 6 patients presented with typical automatism and aura with frequent secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and the other one patient exhibited impaired intelligence. Statistical analysis suggested that the patients without a special disease history (trauma, febrile seizure, or encephalitis) tended to have a more favorable seizure outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical interventions can achieve good therapeutic effect on chronic medically intractable MTLE, and patients without a special disease history may have more favorable outcomes after the surgery.

            "Understanding the development of spatial skills is important for promoting school readiness and improving overall success in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields (e.g., Wai, Lubinski, Benbow, & Steiger, 2010). Children use their spatial skills to understand the world, including visualizing how objects fit together, and can practice them via spatial assembly activities (e.g., puzzles or blocks). These skills are incorporated into measures of overall intelligence and have been linked to success in subjects like mathematics (Mix & Cheng, 2012) and science (Pallrand & Seeber, 1984; Pribyl & Bodner, 1987). This monograph sought to answer four questions about early spatial skill development: 1) Can we reliably measure spatial skills in 3- and 4-year-olds?; 2) Do spatial skills measured at 3 predict spatial skills at age 5?; 3) Do preschool spatial skills predict mathematics skills at age 5?; and 4) What factors contribute to individual differences in preschool spatial skills (e.g., SES, gender, fine-motor skills, vocabulary, and executive function)? Longitudinal data generated from a new spatial skill test for 3-year-old children, called the TOSA (Test of Spatial Assembly), show that it is a reliable and valid measure of early spatial skills that provides strong prediction to spatial skills measured with established tests at age 5. New data using this measure finds links between early spatial skill and mathematics, language, and executive function skills. Analyses suggest that preschool spatial experiences may play a central role in children's mathematical skills around the time of school entry. Executive function skills provide an additional unique contribution to predicting mathematical performance. In addition, individual differences, specifically socioeconomic status, are related to spatial and mathematical skill. We conclude by exploring ways of providing rich early spatial experiences to children.\n",

METHODS: We used well-accepted neuropsychological tests of memory and executive functions to assess 42 patients who had obsessive-compulsive disorder without comorbidity, and 42 healthy controls. We matched the patients and controls pairwise by sex, age, and years of education. RESULTS: The patients performed significantly worse than the controls on the Rey Complex Figure Test, which assesses visuospatial memory and organizational skills. This group difference remained after we controlled for age, education, intelligence, and severity of depressive symptoms.

An analysis of the effect size was used to investigate the strength of criteria for diagnosing NLD considering 35 empirical studies published from January 1980 to February 2011. Overall, our results showed that the most important criteria for distinguishing children with NLD from controls were as follows: a low visuospatial intelligence with a relatively good verbal intelligence, visuoconstructive and fine-motor coordination impairments, good reading decoding together with low math performance. Deficits in visuospatial memory and social skills were also present. A preliminary set of criteria for diagnosing NLD was developed on these grounds.

METHODS: Twenty-eight pediatric-onset relapsing-remitting MS patients (21 girls; mean age 16.2 years; mean disease duration 4.3 years, median Expanded Disability Status Scale 1.25) were compared to 33 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological evaluation to assess intelligence, attention, processing speed, language, visuo-motor integration, and fine-motor dexterity. Associations between cognitive outcomes and cerebellar volume independent of cerebral volume were examined. RESULTS: Cognitive and motor performance of the MS group was reduced relative to controls (all p<0.003). While cerebellar volumes did not differ between groups, cerebellar posterior lobe volume and infratentorial lesion volume accounted for extra variance on measures of information processing (R(2)=0.43; p=0.02) and vocabulary (R(2)=0.56; p=0.04) in patients (controlling for cerebral volume and sex), but not in controls.

The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of temperament and attention on the cognition of school-age children who were born preterm, controlling for socioeconomic variables. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample was composed of 50 six-year-old children who were born preterm with very low birth weight. The children were evaluated using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) and the Cancellation Attention Test. The mothers were interviewed using the Children's Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ). Statistical multiple linear regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: 70% of the children presented average or above-average full intellectual quotient (IQ). In the attention total score, 74% of the children were also within the average range or above. High verbal IQ associated with high maternal schooling explained 73% variability of the full IQ. High attention and maternal schooling, associated with children's temperament with more effortful control, explained 35% variability of the verbal IQ. High attention, associated with high maternal schooling and socioeconomic level, explained 37% variability of the performance IQ. The neonatal clinical variables (gestational age, birth weight, 5th-minute Apgar, and length of stay in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and hospital) were not predictors of cognitive outcomes. CONCLUSION: The majority of the children who were born preterm presented average or above-average cognitive and attentional performances at school age, demonstrating potential resources for learning. Taken together, attention and temperament, associated with maternal schooling and socioeconomic status, were predictors of cognitive outcomes of children born preterm at school age.\n",

DESIGN: Prospective follow-up study. SETTING: Regional population of children born very preterm in Turku University Hospital, Finland, in 2001-2006. PATIENTS: A total of 170 children born very preterm were followed up until 11 years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Motor and cognitive outcomes were evaluated using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children - Second Edition (Movement ABC-2) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fourth Edition, respectively, and HRQoL using the 17-Dimensional Illustrated Questionnaire (17D). The Touwen neurological examination was performed to exclude other neurological conditions affecting the motor outcome. RESULTS: Eighteen children born very preterm (17 boys) (11.3%) had DCD, defined as Movement ABC-2 total test score </=5th percentile. A positive correlation between motor and cognitive outcome (r=0.22, p=0.006) was found. Children born very preterm with DCD had lower cognitive scores than those without DCD (Full-Scale IQ mean 76.8 vs 91.6, p=0.001). Moreover, children born very preterm with DCD reported lower HRQoL than children born very preterm without motor impairment (17D mean 0.93 vs 0.96, p=0.03). However, HRQoL was higher in this group of children born very preterm compared with population-based normative test results (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: DCD was still common at 11 years of age in children born very preterm in 2000s. DCD associated with adverse cognitive development and lower self-experienced HRQoL. However, this group of children born very preterm reported better HRQoL in comparison with Finnish norms.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Prematurely born individuals have an increased risk for long-term neurocognitive impairments. In animal models, development of the cholinergic basal forebrain (cBF) is selectively vulnerable to adverse effects of perinatal stressors, and impaired cBF integrity results in lasting cognitive deficits. We hypothesized that cBF integrity is impaired in prematurely born individuals and mediates adult cognitive impairments associated with prematurity. METHODS: We used magnetic resonance imaging-based volumetric assessments of a cytoarchitectonically defined cBF region of interest to determine differences in cBF integrity between 99 adults who were born very preterm and/or with very low birth weight and 106 term-born control subjects from the same birth cohort. Magnetic resonance imaging-derived cBF volumes were studied in relation to neonatal clinical complications after delivery and intelligence measures (IQ) in adulthood. RESULTS: In adults who were born very preterm and/or with very low birth weight, cBF volumes were significantly reduced compared with term-born adults (-4.5% [F(1,202) = 11.82, p = .001]). Lower cBF volume in adults who were born very preterm and/or with very low birth weight was specifically associated with both neonatal complications (r(part,92) = -.35, p < .001) and adult IQ (r(part,88) = .33, p = .001) even after controlling for global gray matter and white matter volume. In a path analytic model, cBF volume significantly mediated the association between neonatal complications and adult cognitive deficits. CONCLUSIONS: We provide first-time evidence in humans that cBF integrity is impaired after premature birth and links neonatal complications with long-term cognitive outcome. Data suggest that cholinergic system abnormalities may play a relevant role for long-term neurocognitive impairments associated with premature delivery.\n",

            "AIM: To estimate the association between very preterm birth (<32wks' gestation) and intelligence, executive functioning, and processing speed throughout childhood and adolescence, and to examine the effects of gestational age, birthweight, and age at assessment. METHOD: Studies were included if children were born at earlier than 32 weeks' gestation, aged 4 to 17 years, had an age-matched term control group, and if the studies used standardized measures, were published in an English-language peer-reviewed journal, and placed no restrictions on participants based on task performance. RESULTS: We evaluated 6163 children born very preterm and 5471 term-born controls from 60 studies. Children born very preterm scored 0.82 SDs (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.90; p<0.001) lower on intelligence tests, 0.51 SDs (95% CI 0.44-0.58; p<0.001) lower on measures of executive functioning, and 0.49 SDs (95% CI 0.39-0.60; p<0.001) lower on measures of processing speed than term-born controls. Gestational age and birthweight were associated with study effect size in intelligence and executive functioning of younger children only. Age at assessment was not associated with study effect size.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data obtained from a cohort of children who underwent epilepsy surgery between January 1996 and September 2010. We performed simple and multiple regression analyses to identify predictors associated with IQ change after surgery. In addition to parental education, six variables previously demonstrated to be associated with IQ change after surgery were included as predictors: age at surgery, duration of epilepsy, etiology, presurgical IQ, reduction of antiepileptic drugs, and seizure freedom. We used delta IQ (IQ 2 years after surgery minus IQ shortly before surgery) as the primary outcome variable, but also performed analyses with pre- and postsurgical IQ as outcome variables to support our findings. To validate the results we performed simple regression analysis with parental education as the predictor in specific subgroups. RESULTS: The sample for regression analysis included 118 children (60 male; median age at surgery 9.73 years). Parental education was significantly associated with delta IQ in simple regression analysis (p = 0.004), and also contributed significantly to postsurgical IQ in multiple regression analysis (p = 0.008). Additional analyses demonstrated that parental education made a unique contribution to prediction of delta IQ, that is, it could not be replaced by the illness-related variables. Subgroup analyses confirmed the association of parental education with IQ change after surgery for most groups. SIGNIFICANCE: Children whose parents had higher education demonstrate on average a greater increase in IQ after surgery and a higher postsurgical--but not presurgical--IQ than children whose parents completed at most lower secondary education. Parental education--and perhaps other environmental variables--should be considered in the prognosis of cognitive function after childhood epilepsy surgery.\n",

METHODS: The Nova Scotia childhood epilepsy cohort is population based and includes all children in this Canadian province who developed epilepsy between 1977 and 1985. Eligible patients had >/=10 years of follow-up. Children with childhood absence epilepsy were excluded. Total family income at seizure onset was assessed at seizure onset and classified as \"poor\" (first quintile), \"adequate\" (second to third quintiles), and \"well-off\" (fourth to fifth quintiles). We also assessed parental education and home ownership. Social outcome was assessed in those with normal intelligence who were >/=18 years of age at the end of follow-up using a semistructured interview that explored eight adverse effects. RESULTS: Of 584 patients, 421 (72%) were included. Average follow-up was 26 +/- 5.6 years. Overall 137 families (33%) had \"poor\" income, 159 (38%) had \"adequate income,\" and 125 (30%) were \"well-off.\" Terminal remission of epilepsy occurred in 65% of the poor, 61% of the adequate, and 61% of the well-off (p = ns). Intractable epilepsy, status epilepticus, number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used, and the number of generalized tonic-clonic or focal with secondary generalization seizures through the clinical course was the same in all groups. Home ownership did not predict remission. Neither paternal nor maternal education was associated with remission. Poor children had significantly more adverse social outcomes including failure to graduate from high school, unemployment, personal poverty, inadvertent pregnancy, and psychiatric diagnoses. SIGNIFICANCE: In Nova Scotia with universal health care, coming from a poor or more affluent family does not seem to affect the clinical course or long-term seizure outcome of childhood epilepsy. Unfortunately children from poor families are less likely to have a good social outcome.\n",

METHODS: In this longitudinal study we tested 186 patients with TBI and 54 healthy controls from the Vietnam Head Injury Study. Childhood SES was determined for each participant based on parental educational attainment and occupational prestige. General intelligence was initially assessed pre-injury upon induction into the military, and again 15, 35 and 40+ years post-injury. We examined whether childhood SES, total brain volume loss and lesion laterality can predict post-injury intelligence scores and the rate of change in those scores between study phases. RESULTS: For both participants with and without TBI, childhood SES accounted for a significant portion of the variance in intelligence scores pre-injury and in all three post-injury evaluations, however, it was not associated with the rate of cognitive change. Lastly, childhood SES predicted cognitive outcome among patients with left hemisphere damage better than it did for right hemisphere damage patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide the first evidence indicating the persistent effects of childhood SES on intelligence scores later in adulthood following a TBI.

            "BACKGROUND: An association between higher intelligence and lower probability of serious depression has previously been established. Yet, to our knowledge, no large prospective study has examined the relationship across the lifespan. METHODS: A cohort of 49,321 Swedish men was followed from conscription in 1969-70 (age 18-20) through to 2008. Odds ratios (OR) for first time hospitalisation for depression (FTHD) were calculated in relation to intelligence for distinct time periods across the lifespan, while controlling for established risk factors for depression. RESULTS: There was a linear association between higher intelligence in youth and lower odds for FTHD during the entire follow-up period, 1973-2008. The association got progressively weaker across the lifespan. During 1973-80, one step down on the stanine scale was associated with an unadjusted increase in OR of 1.34 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-1.42], adjusted OR 1.23 [1.15-1.32]; while, during 2001-2008, the ORs were less than half of the magnitude of the first period, unadjusted 1.14 [1.07-1.21], and adjusted 1.09 [1.01-1.17]. LIMITATIONS: The study includes men only, and the number of available places for in-patient care decreased during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: For the first time, we have shown that the association between lower intelligence and depression decreases over time. The attenuation of the association in the adjusted models suggests a slower accumulation of depressogenic stressors among people with a higher IQ-score. Further exploration of intelligence's role in the etiology of depression across the lifespan is required in order to facilitate adequate diagnoses and ameliorating interventions.\n",

This positive correlation might arise from socioeconomic status influencing both intelligence and health; intelligence leading to better health behaviours; and/or some shared genetic factors influencing both intelligence and health. Distinguishing among these hypotheses is crucial for medicine and public health, but can only be accomplished by studying a genetically informative sample. METHODS: We analysed data from three genetically informative samples containing information on intelligence and mortality: Sample 1, 377 pairs of male veterans from the NAS-NRC US World War II Twin Registry; Sample 2, 246 pairs of twins from the Swedish Twin Registry; and Sample 3, 784 pairs of twins from the Danish Twin Registry. The age at which intelligence was measured differed between the samples. We used three methods of genetic analysis to examine the relationship between intelligence and lifespan: we calculated the proportion of the more intelligent twins who outlived their co-twin; we regressed within-twin-pair lifespan differences on within-twin-pair intelligence differences; and we used the resulting regression coefficients to model the additive genetic covariance. We conducted a meta-analysis of the regression coefficients across the three samples. RESULTS: The combined (and all three individual samples) showed a small positive phenotypic correlation between intelligence and lifespan. In the combined sample observed r = .12 (95% confidence interval .06 to .18). The additive genetic covariance model supported a genetic relationship between intelligence and lifespan. In the combined sample the genetic contribution to the covariance was 95%; in the US study, 84%; in the Swedish study, 86%, and in the Danish study, 85%.

PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the association between infant socioeconomic status (SES), and Eysenck personality traits in adulthood. An additional aim was to investigate whether intelligence and education may mediate this association. METHODS: SES of 9125 children in the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort was recorded at a 1-year examination. A subsample of this cohort, comprising 1182 individuals, participated in a follow-up at 20-34 years and was administered the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) which includes measures of neuroticism, extraversion, psychoticism and the so-called lie-scale. Associations of SES with each of the four personality traits were analysed by bivariate and partial correlations, and the mediating effects of intelligence and years of education were analysed. RESULTS: Higher SES in infancy was associated with lower neuroticism (r = -0.06; p = 0.05), lower lie-scale scores (r = -0.11; p = 0.0002), and higher psychoticism (r = 0.09; p = 0.003). However, analyses of mediation revealed no direct effect of infant SES on any of the adult personality traits, but only indirect effects mediated by intelligence and years of education, with intelligence being the main mediating factor. CONCLUSION: Only weak associations were observed between infant SES and personality in young adulthood, and the observed associations were mediated by adult intelligence and educational level. Thus, factors associated with infant SES or family background appears to have weak direct effects on personality development.\n",

            "Across five studies (three preregistered; N = 2,481), we investigated two effects as follows: (1) Is higher subjective economic inequality associated with a decreased ability to accurately identify emotions (emotional intelligence)? When inequality is high, people are less focused on others and may thus be less motivated to correctly identify their emotions. (2) Is this main effect of subjective inequality qualified by an interaction with socioeconomic status (SES)? Past research suggests that high SES leads to lower emotional intelligence because people of higher SES are less dependent on others and thus less motivated to identify their emotions. When perceiving higher inequality, high SES individuals should feel even more self-reliant, thereby exacerbating the difference in emotional intelligence between people of low and high SES. We provide empirical support in three out of five studies for the first and in four out of five studies for the second hypothesis. An internal meta-analysis supported both hypotheses.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: IQ deficits are linked to even mild obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in children. Although OSA is commonly first diagnosed in the pre-school age group, a randomised trial is still needed to assess IQ outcomes after adenotonsillectomy in the pre-school age-group. This randomised control trial (RCT) will primarily determine whether adenotonsillectomy improves IQ compared to no adenotonsillectomy after 12 months, in preschool (3-5 year-old) children with mild to moderate OSA. METHODS: This protocol is for an ongoing multi-centred RCT with a recruitment target of 210 subjects (105 in each arm). Children age 3-5 years with symptoms of OSA, are recruited through doctor referral, at the point of referral to the Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) services. Screening is initially with a questionnaire (Paediatric Sleep Questionnaire, PSQ) for symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Where questionnaires are positive (suggestive of OSA) and ENT surgeons recommend them for adenotonsillectomy, they are invited to participate in POSTA. Baseline testing includes neurocognitive testing (IQ and psychometric evaluation with the neuropsychologist blinded to randomisation) and overnight polysomnography (PSG). Where the Obstructive Apnoea-Hypopnea Index (OAHI) from the PSG is <10/h per hour, consent for randomisation is sought; children with severe OSA (OAHI >/= 10/h) are sent for immediate treatment and excluded from the study. After consent is obtained, participants are randomised to early surgery (within 2 months) or to surgery after a usual wait time of 12 months. Follow-up studies include repeat neurocognitive testing and PSG at 12 (with the waiting list group studied before their surgery) and 24 months after randomisation. Analysis will be by intention to treat. The primary outcome is IQ at 12 months' follow-up. DISCUSSION: If IQ deficits associated with OSA are reversible 12 months after adenotonsillectomy compared to controls, future clinical practice advise would be to undertake early surgery in young children with OSA. The study could provide data on whether a window of opportunity exists for reversing IQ deficits linked to OSA in the pre-school age-group.

This systematic review with meta-analysis aims to 1) establish whether SDB differentially impacts various neurocognitive domains (intelligence, attention/executive functions, memory, visual spatial skills, and language) and 2) examine the effects of several moderating factors. Database searches, conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines, identified 77 studies that met pre-determined criteria, 63 of which were included in the meta-analysis. Most studies were of moderate to high quality. Children with SDB had significant impairments in all cognitive domains, albeit of different magnitude. The largest impairments were found in intelligence (verbal and overall). With respect to severity of SDB, neurocognitive deficits were evident in children with primary snoring (PS) as well as in children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Other moderators: higher body mass index, younger age at testing, using questionnaires rather than polysomnography, and employing a control group instead of normative data, related to poorer neurocognitive outcomes in select domains. Overall, our study provides robust evidence of multiple neurocognitive impairments in children with SDB, with no evidence of sparing in children with PS. The findings of our study provide impetus for research and interventions for children with SDB across all severities.\n",

Studies on cognitive performance of OSAS children treated with or without AT were identified by searching the Pubmed, EMBASE and Cochrane library. A meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the literature. The random-effects model was used to evaluate 11 eligible studies using an inverse- variance method. The neuropsychological test results of 4 cognitive domains (general intelligence, memory, attention-executive function and verbal ability) were obtained and analyzed. By comparison of cognitive function between OSAS children and healthy controls, the effect sizes of each domain were achieved as follows: general intelligence,-0.5 (P<0.0001); memory,-0.18 (P=0.02); attention-executive function,-0.21 (P=0.002); and verbal ability,-0.48 (P=0.0006). The effect sizes of general intelligence, memory, attention-executive function, and verbal ability after AT compared to baseline level were-0.37 (P=0.008),-0.36 (P=0.0005),-0.02 (P=0.88), and-0.45 (P=0.009), respectively.

Our results confirmed that OSAS children performed worse than healthy children in terms of the 4 cognitive domains investigated. After 6-12 months of observation, significant improvement in attention-executive function and verbal ability were found in OSAS children treated with AT compared to their baseline level; restoration of attention-executive function and memory were observed in OSAS children after AT in comparison to healthy controls.

METHODS: Children aged 6-11 years diagnosed with mild OSA (i.e., an apnea hypopnea index <5.0) were recruited and compared with age and gender-matched healthy controls. Polysomnographic recordings were analyzed for sleep microstructure and spindle activity. All children completed also an intelligence test battery (i.e., the Wechsler intelligence test for children, 4th version). RESULTS: Nineteen children with OSA (13 boys, mean age 7.1 +/- 1.4 y), and 14 controls (7 boys, mean age 8.1 +/- 1.9 y) were included. Mean IQ was 110 +/- 12 for the complete sample, in children with OSA 111 +/- 13, and in controls 108 +/- 12 (p = 0.602). Controls showed a higher spindle index in N2 stage than children with OSA: 143.0 +/- 42.5 vs 89.5 +/- 56.9, respectively (p = 0.003). Spindle index in NREM was strongly and significantly correlated with Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), Working Memory Index (WMI), Processing Speed Index (PSI), and total IQ in children with OSA. CONCLUSIONS: Children with mild OSA demonstrate a different pattern of sleep spindle activity that seems to be linked with neurocognitive performance, especially concerning memory. Sleep spindle activity seems to be involved with mechanisms related with neurocognitive consequences in children with OSA.\n",

            "OBJECTIVE: Debate continues over proper surgical treatment for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Few large comprehensive studies exist that have examined outcomes for the subtemporal selective amygdalohippocampectomy (sSAH) approach. This study describes a minimally invasive technique for sSAH and examines seizure and neuropsychological outcomes in a large series of patients who underwent sSAH for MTLE. METHODS: Data for 152 patients (94 women, 61.8%; 58 men, 38.2%) who underwent sSAH performed by a single surgeon were retrospectively reviewed. The sSAH technique involves a small, minimally invasive opening and preserves the anterolateral temporal lobe and the temporal stem. RESULTS: All patients in the study had at least 1 year of follow-up (mean [SD] 4.52 [2.57] years), of whom 57.9% (88/152) had Engel class I seizure outcomes. Of the patients with at least 2 years of follow-up (mean [SD] 5.2 [2.36] years), 56.5% (70/124) had Engel class I seizure outcomes. Preoperative and postoperative neuropsychological test results indicated no significant change in intelligence, verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, attention and processing, cognitive flexibility, visuospatial memory, or mood. There was a significant change in word retrieval regardless of the side of surgery and a significant change in verbal memory in patients who underwent dominant-side resection (p < 0.05). Complication rates were low, with a 1.3% (2/152) permanent morbidity rate and 0.0% mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports a large series of patients who have undergone sSAH, with a comprehensive presentation of a minimally invasive technique.

The main questions addressed by this study were (1) Does auditory deprivation result in global or domain-specific deficits in working memory in children with CIs compared with their NH age mates? (2) Does the potential for verbal recoding affect performance on measures of reasoning ability in children with CIs relative to their NH age mates? and (3) Is performance on verbal and visuospatial working memory tasks related to spoken receptive language level achieved by children with CIs? DESIGN: A total of 54 children ranging in age from 5 to 9 years participated; 25 children with CIs and 29 children with NH. Participants were tested on both simple and complex measures of verbal and visuospatial working memory. Vocabulary was assessed with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) and reasoning abilities with two subtests of the WISC-IV (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition): Picture Concepts (verbally mediated) and Matrix Reasoning (visuospatial task). Groups were compared on all measures using analysis of variance after controlling for age and maternal education. RESULTS: Children with CIs scored significantly lower than children with NH on measures of working memory, after accounting for age and maternal education. Differences between the groups were more apparent for verbal working memory compared with visuospatial working memory. For reasoning and vocabulary, the CI group scored significantly lower than the NH group for PPVT and WISC Picture Concepts but similar to NH age mates on WISC Matrix Reasoning. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest that children with CIs have deficits in working memory related to storing and processing verbal information in working memory. These deficits extend to receptive vocabulary and verbal reasoning and remain even after controlling for the higher maternal education level of the NH group. Their ability to store and process visuospatial information in working memory and complete reasoning tasks that minimize verbal labeling of stimuli more closely approaches performance of NH age mates.\n",

            "PURPOSE: With the advent of new very selective techniques like thermal laser ablation to treat drug-resistant focal epilepsy, the controversy of resection size in relation to seizure outcome versus cognitive deficits has gained new relevance. The purpose of this study was to test the influence of the selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SAH) versus nonselective temporal lobe resection (TLR) on seizure outcome and cognition in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and histopathological verified hippocampal sclerosis (HS). METHODS: We identified 108 adults (>16years) with HS, operated between 1995 and 2009 in Denmark. Exclusion criteria are the following: Intelligence below normal range, right hemisphere dominance, other native languages than Danish, dual pathology, and missing follow-up data. Thus, 56 patients were analyzed. The patients were allocated to SAH (n=22) or TLR (n=34) based on intraoperative electrocorticography. Verbal learning and verbal memory were tested pre- and postsurgery. RESULTS: Seizure outcome did not differ between patients operated using the SAH versus the TLR at 1year (p=0.951) nor at 7years (p=0.177). Verbal learning was more affected in patients resected in the left hemisphere than in the right (p=0.002). In patients with left-sided TLR, a worsening in verbal memory performance was found (p=0.011). Altogether, 73% were seizure-free for 1year and 64% for 7years after surgery. CONCLUSION: In patients with drug-resistant focal MTLE, HS and no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signs of dual pathology, selective amygdalohippocampectomy results in sustained seizure freedom and better memory function compared with patients operated with nonselective temporal lobe resection.\n",

SeAH and ATL were used in 39 and 33 patients, respectively. All eligible patients were followed up at least one year. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised were used to test the patients' neuropsychology before and after the surgery for one year.  Results: Fifty-nine patients (81.9%) achieved satisfactory seizure control (62.5% Engel Class I and 19.4% Class II). ATL obtained 84.8% satisfactory seizure control (28 patients), and the success rate was 79.5% (31 patients) for SeAH. There was no significant difference in seizure control between SeAH and ATL (P=0.760). The postoperative verbal IQ of SeAH group increased significantly in both side surgery (P<0.05), while the increase was not significant in the group of ATL of both side surgery (P>0.05). Regarding left-side surgery, postoperative verbal memory and total memory were increased significantly in the group of SeAH (P<0.05), while the increases were not significant in the group of ATL (P>0.05). In the right-side surgery, postoperative verbal memory and total memory were increased significantly in the two surgery strategy groups (P<0.05), while no significant increases were seen in non-verbal memory of the two surgery strategy groups (P>0.05).  Conclusion: Microsurgery for the treatment of refractory MTLE is successful and safe, and should be encouraged.

The present prospective longitudinal study evaluates the association between prenatal maternal cortisol concentrations and child neurodevelopment. Participants included a low risk sample of 91 mother-child pairs. Prenatal maternal plasma cortisol concentrations were measured at 19 and 31 gestational weeks. Brain development and cognitive functioning were assessed when children were 6-9 years of age. Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired and cortical thickness was determined. Child cognitive functioning was evaluated using standardized measures (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children IV and Expressive Vocabulary Test, Second Edition). Higher maternal cortisol concentrations during the third trimester were associated with greater child cortical thickness primarily in frontal regions. No significant associations were observed between prenatal maternal cortisol concentrations and child cortical thinning. Elevated third trimester maternal cortisol additionally was associated with enhanced child cognitive performance. Findings in this normative sample of typically developing children suggest that elevated maternal cortisol during late gestation exert lasting benefits for brain development and cognitive functioning 6-9 years later. The benefits of fetal exposure to higher maternal cortisol during the third trimester for child neurodevelopment are consistent with the role cortisol plays in maturation of the human fetus. It is plausible that more extreme elevations in maternal cortisol concentrations late in gestation, as well as exposure to pharmacological levels of synthetic glucocorticoids, may have neurotoxic effects on the developing fetal brain.\n",

            "The most common thyroid diseases during pregnancy are hyper- and hypothyroidism and their variants including isolated hypothyroxinemia (hypo-T4), autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and different types of goiter. AITD represents the main cause of hypothyroidism during pregnancy ranging in prevalence between 5 and 20% with an average of 7.8%. The incidence of isolated hypo-T4 is about 150 times higher compared to congenital hypothyroidism. Prevalence of Graves' disease (GD) ranges between 0.1% and 1% and the Transient Gestational Hyperthyroidism Syndrome between 1 and 3%. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is a sensitive marker of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy. Normal values have been modified recently with a downward shift. Thus, the upper normal range is now considered to be 2.5 mUI/mL in the first trimester and 3.0 mUI/mL for the remainder of pregnancy. Most studies have shown that children born to women with hypothyroidism during gestation had significantly lower scores in neuropsychological tests related to intelligence, attention, language, reading ability, school performance and visual motor performance. However, some studies have not confirmed these findings. On the other hand, multiple retrospective studies have shown that the risks of maternal and fetal/neonatal complications are directly related to the duration and inadequate control of maternal thyrotoxicosis. The latter is associated with a risk of spontaneous abortion, congestive heart failure, thyrotoxic storm, preeclampsia, preterm delivery, low birth weight and stillbirth. Despite the lack of consensus among professional organizations, recent studies, which are based on sophisticated analyses, support universal screening in all pregnant women in the first trimester for thyroid diseases.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Maternal prenatal infections have been linked to children's neurodevelopment and cognitive outcomes. It remains unclear, however, whether infections occurring during specific vulnerable gestational periods can affect children's cognitive outcomes. The study aimed to examine maternal infections in each trimester of pregnancy and associations with children's developmental and intelligence quotients. The ALSPAC birth cohort was used to investigate associations between maternal infections in pregnancy and child cognitive outcomes. METHODS: Infection data from mothers and cognition data from children were included with the final study sample size comprising 7,410 mother-child participants. Regression analysis was used to examine links between maternal infections occurring at each trimester of pregnancy and children's cognition at 18 months, 4 years, and 8 years. RESULTS: Infections in the third trimester were significantly associated with decreased verbal IQ at age 4 (p < .05, adjusted R(2) = 0.004); decreased verbal IQ (p < .01, adjusted R(2) = 0.001), performance IQ (p < .01, adjusted R(2) = 0.0008), and total IQ at age 8 (p < .01, adjusted R(2) = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Results suggest that maternal infections in the third trimester could have a latent effect on cognitive development, only emerging when cognitive load increases over time, though magnitude of effect appears to be small. Performance IQ may be more vulnerable to trimester-specific exposure to maternal infection as compared to verbal IQ. Future research could include examining potential mediating mechanisms on childhood cognition, such as possible moderating effects of early childhood environmental factors, and if effects persist in future cognitive outcomes.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) are autoimmune diseases that affect women of childbearing age. Pregnancies in these patients carry several complications such as prematurity. Maternal IgG antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) can cross the placenta but they don't generally cause any neonatal thrombotic event. Because of the incompleteness of the fetal blood-brain barrier, aPL could theoretically reach the fetal brain. Whether this can have an effect on brain development is still under investigation. Some studies performed in children of patients with SLE and/or APS showed an increased number of learning disabilities without impairment in intelligence level. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this article are to evaluate the neurodevelopment outcome in 30 children (median age 9 years) born to mothers with SLE and/or APS with IgG anti-beta2-glycoprotein I during the third trimester of pregnancy and found positive for the same antibodies at birth. METHODS: A neurological physical exam was performed in all children. We submitted some questionnaires to the mothers: the Child Behavior CheckList (CBCL) and a homemade set of questions obtained by a team composed of rheumatologists and pediatric neurologists. Intellectual functioning was determined by the Wechsler scale for corrected age. RESULTS: In all children neurological physical exam and intelligence levels were found to be normal but mild behavior disorders and history of neurological manifestations were shown in three children. CONCLUSIONS: Offspring of patients with SLE and/or APS are generally healthy. We and others observed the occurrence of minor neurological disorders that might be related to maternal disease or to prematurity. The limited number of the available data on this sensitive issue supports the need for further studies.\n",

Here, we examined the response of cognitive symptoms to antipsychotic medications in 71 inpatients with schizophrenia on and off antipsychotic medications in a blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study design. Patients received either antipsychotic medication monotherapy or placebo for 4-6 weeks before switching conditions. Neuropsychological testing, including working memory, intelligence, episodic memory, and verbal fluency tests, was administered during each condition. Additionally, we assessed whether polygenic scores for cognitive ability (PGS(cog)) related to variability in antipsychotic medication-induced changes in cognitive performance. Overall, significant changes in cognition were not observed in response to medications (p's > 0.05) except for in episodic memory (p = 0.01), which showed a medication-related improvement. Some antipsychotic medication-related cognitive changes were associated with genetic predisposition to cognitive ability: PGS(cog) showed positive correlations with medication-induced improvements in verbal list learning (p = 0.02) and category fluency (p = 0.03). Our primary results reinforce the notion that in general, cognitive measures are minimally responsive to antipsychotic medication. However, PGS(cog) results suggest that genetic variation may influence the ability of current treatments to affect cognitive change within this patient population. This study underscores the need for development of novel treatment options specifically targeting cognitive symptoms as well as the importance of genetic variability in treatment response for patients with schizophrenia.\n",

This technique has been applied for tracking brain degeneration in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases with high sensitivity and reliability. Here we applied TBM to quantify changes in brain structure after completing a challenging adaptive cognitive training program based on the n-back task. Twenty-six young women completed twenty-four training sessions across twelve weeks and they showed, on average, large cognitive improvements. High-resolution MRI scans were obtained before and after training. The computed longitudinal deformation maps were analyzed for answering three questions: (a) Are there differential brain structural changes in the training group as compared with a matched control group? (b) Are these changes related to performance differences in the training program? (c) Are standardized changes in a set of psychological factors (fluid and crystallized intelligence, working memory, and attention control) measured before and after training, related to structural changes in the brain? Results showed (a) greater structural changes for the training group in the temporal lobe, (b) a negative correlation between these changes and performance across training sessions (the greater the structural change, the lower the cognitive performance improvements), and (c) negligible effects regarding the psychological factors measured before and after training.\n",

AIMS: To test prospective associations between adolescent mental health problems and mental wellbeing and life satisfaction in early old age. METHODS: A total of 1561 men and women were drawn from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (the British 1946 birth cohort). Teachers had previously completed rating scales to assess emotional adjustment and behaviours, which allowed us to extract factors of mental health problems measuring self-organisation, behavioural problems, and emotional problems during adolescence. Between the ages of 60-64 years, mental wellbeing was assessed using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) and life satisfaction was self-reported using the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). RESULTS: After controlling for gender, social class of origin, childhood cognitive ability, and educational attainment, adolescent emotional problems were independently inversely associated with mental wellbeing and with life satisfaction. Symptoms of anxiety/depression at 60-64 years explained the association with life satisfaction but not with mental wellbeing. Associations between adolescent self-organisation and conduct problems and mental wellbeing and life satisfaction were of negligible magnitude, but higher childhood cognitive ability significantly predicted poor life satisfaction in early old age. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent self-organisation and conduct problems may not be predictive of future mental wellbeing and life satisfaction. Adolescent emotional problems may be inversely associated with future wellbeing, and may be associated with lower levels of future life satisfaction through symptoms of anxiety/depression in early old age. Initiatives to prevent and treat emotional problems in adolescence may have long-term benefits which extend into older age.\n",

METHODS: This study was an analysis of longitudinal data from children age 3-19 years, with perinatal HIV infection, with and without prescriptions for stimulant medications [prescription (PG) and comparison (CG) groups, respectively], matched on age, availability of CD4% and outcome measures of cognition, behavior and QOL. Generalized estimating equation models were used to evaluate effects of stimulant exposure on change in measured outcomes over 3 years of follow-up, adjusting for baseline levels of outcomes and relevant covariates. RESULTS: Children in both the PG (n = 132) and the CG (n = 392) obtained mean verbal and performance (nonverbal) intelligence quotients (VIQ and PIQ, respectively) in the low-average range for age. At baseline, those in PG demonstrated more frequent signs of hyperactivity, impulsivity and conduct and learning problems than those in CG (P </= 0.003 in unadjusted analyses). At follow-up, after adjustment for baseline functioning and other relevant covariates, there were no significant changes from baseline in VIQ or PIQ. Stimulant prescription use, however, was associated with worsening symptoms of hyperactivity (P = 0.01), impulsivity (P = 0.04), learning problems (P < 0.001) and worsening of perceived health status (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest expectations for behavioral improvement may not align well with long-term effects of stimulant prescription use on behavior and QOL in children with HIV.

We also investigated the stability of positive family relationships into adulthood as one possible pathway underlying this long-term association. Data were from the Fullerton Longitudinal Study (FLS) an ongoing investigation in the United States initiated in 1979 when children were aged 1 year with the most recent data collected in 2017. A cross-informant methodology was employed in which mothers and children independently completed the Positive Family Relationships (PFR) scale annually when children were of ages 9-17 years. When study children reached age 38, they reported on their current PFR, global health, and comprehensive happiness. Structural equation models revealed that children's perceptions of the family during childhood and adolescence predicted both their health and happiness at age 38. Mothers' perspectives of PFR predicted greater adult children's health, but did not predict their happiness. Associations were independent of family socioeconomic status, gender, intelligence, and extraversion. Moreover, while controlling for behavior problems (proxy for health) and happiness at age 17, both children's and mothers' early PFR related to PFR at 38 years, which in turn, predicted increased health and happiness at age 38, thus providing evidence for a pathway underlying this long-term connection. Our prospective findings revealed that families in which members get along well and support each other during the childhood and adolescent years furnish a foundation for positive family relationships in adulthood, which are associated with greater health and happiness.

            "Intellectual functioning is a critical determinant of economic and personal productivity. Identifying early neural predictors of cognitive function in infancy will allow us to map the neurodevelopmental pathways that underpin individual differences in intellect. Here, in three different cohorts we investigate the association between a putative neurophysiological indicator of information encoding (change in frontal theta during a novel video) in infancy and later general cognitive outcome. In a discovery cohort of 12-month-old typically developing infants, we recorded EEG during presentation of dynamic movies of people and objects. Frontal theta power (3-6 Hz) significantly increased during the course of viewing each video. Critically, increase in frontal theta during viewing of a video was associated with a differential response to repetition of that specific video, confirming relation to learning. Further, individual differences in the magnitude of change in frontal theta power were related to concurrent nonverbal cognitive level. We then sought to extend this association in two independent samples enriched for variation in cognitive outcome due to the inclusion of infants at familial risk for autism. We observed similar patterns of theta EEG change at 12 months, and found a predictive relation to verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills measured at 2, 3 and 7 years of age. For the subset of high-risk infants later diagnosed with autism, infant theta EEG explained over 80% of the variance in nonverbal skills at age 3 years. We suggest that EEG theta change in infancy is an excellent candidate predictive biomarker that could yield substantial insight into the mechanisms that underlie individual differences in childhood intelligence, particularly in high risk populations.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Disease and therapy cause brain damage and subsequent functional loss in pediatric patients with posterior fossa tumors. Treatment-related toxicity factors are resection in patients with pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) and, additionally, cranio-spinal irradiation together with chemotherapy in patients with medulloblastoma (MB). We tested whether damage to white matter (WM) as revealed by diffusion tensor MR imaging (DTI) correlated with specific cognitive and motor impairments in survivors of pediatric posterior fossa tumors. PROCEDURES: Eighteen MB (mean age +/- SD, 15.2 +/- 4.9 y) and 14 PA (12.6 +/- 5.0 y) survivors were investigated with DTI on a 3-Tesla-MR system. We identified fractional anisotropy (FA) of WM, the volume ratio of WM to gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid (WM/GM + CSF), and volume of specific frontocerebellar tracts. Ataxia was assessed using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS), while the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children determined full-scale intelligence quotients (FSIQ). Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks (ANT) was used to assess processing speed. Handwriting automation was analyzed using a digitizing graphic tablet. RESULTS: The WM/GM + CSF ratio correlated significantly with cognitive measures (IQ, P = 0.002; ANT baseline speed, P = 0.04; ANT shifting attention, P = 0.004). FA of skeletonized tracts correlated significantly with FSIQ (P = 0.008), ANT baseline speed (P = 0.028) and ANT shifting attention (P = 0.045). Moreover, frontocerebellar tract volumes correlated with both the FSIQ (P = 0.011) and ICARS (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: DTI provides a method for quantification of WM damage by tumor and by therapy-associated effects in survivors of pediatric posterior fossa tumors. DTI-derived WM integrity may be a representative marker for cognitive and motor deterioration.\n",

            "Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults, and is primarily characterized by muscle weakness and myotonia, yet some of the most disabling symptoms of the disease are cognitive and behavioral. Here we evaluated several of these non-motor symptoms from a cross-sectional time-point in one of the largest longitudinal studies to date, including full-scale intelligence quotient, depression, anxiety, apathy, sleep, and cerebral white matter fractional anisotropy in a group of 39 adult-onset myotonic dystrophy type 1 participants (27 female) compared to 79 unaffected control participants (46 female). We show that intelligence quotient was significantly associated with depression (P < 0.0001) and anxiety (P = 0.018), but not apathy (P < 0.058) or hypersomnolence (P = 0.266) in the DM1 group. When controlling for intelligence quotient, cerebral white matter fractional anisotropy was significantly associated with apathy (P = 0.042) and hypersomnolence (P = 0.034), but not depression (P = 0.679) or anxiety (P = 0.731) in the myotonic dystrophy type 1 group. Finally, we found that disease duration was significantly associated with apathy (P < 0.0001), hypersomnolence (P < 0.001), IQ (P = 0.038), and cerebral white matter fractional anisotropy (P < 0.001), but not depression (P = 0.271) or anxiety (P = 0.508). Our results support the hypothesis that cognitive deficits, hypersomnolence, and apathy, are due to the underlying neuropathology of myotonic dystrophy type 1, as measured by cerebral white matter fractional anisotropy and disease duration. Whereas elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety in myotonic dystrophy type 1 are secondary to the physical symptoms and the emotional stress of coping with a chronic and debilitating disease. Results from this work contribute to a better understanding of disease neuropathology and represent important therapeutic targets for clinical trials.\n",

Results showed distinct relationships between these basic structural brain parameters and higher cognition, highlighted by a highly significant correlation of left rACC gray matter volume with memory, and to a lesser extent, though still statistically significant, correlation of left posterior mOFC-rACC FA with intelligence. Regression analyses showed that left posterior mOFC-rACC connections and left rACC gray matter volume each contributed to intelligence, with left posterior mOFC-rACC FA uniquely accounting for between 20.43 and 24.99% of the variance in intelligence, in comparison to 13.54 to 17.98% uniquely explained by left rACC gray matter volume. For memory, only left rACC gray matter volume explained neuropsychological performance, uniquely accounting for a remarkably high portion of individual variation, ranging from 73.61 to 79.21%. These results pointed to differential contributions of white mater microstructure connections and gray matter volumes to individual differences in intelligence and memory, respectively.\n",

            "OBJECTIVE: The microstructural integrity of gray and white matter is decreased in adult moyamoya disease, suggesting covert ischemic injury as a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction. Establishing a microstructural brain imaging marker is critical for monitoring cognitive outcomes following surgical interventions. The authors of the present study determined the pathophysiological basis of altered microstructural brain injury in relation to advanced arterial occlusion, cerebral hypoperfusion, and cognitive function. METHODS: The authors examined 58 patients without apparent brain lesions and 30 healthy controls by using structural MRI, as well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Arterial occlusion in each hemisphere was classified as early or advanced stage based on MRA and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) involvement. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured with N-isopropyl-p-[123I]-iodoamphetamine SPECT. Furthermore, cognitive performance was examined using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition and the Trail Making Test (TMT). Both voxel- and region of interest-based analyses were performed for groupwise comparisons, as well as correlation analysis, using parameters such as cognitive test scores; gray matter volume; fractional anisotropy (FA) of association fiber tracts, including the inferior frontooccipital fasciculus (IFOF) and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF); PCA involvement; and rCBF. RESULTS: Compared to the early stages, advanced stages of arterial occlusion in the left hemisphere were associated with a lower Performance IQ (p = 0.031), decreased anterior cingulate volumes (p = 0.0001, uncorrected), and lower FA in the IFOF, cingulum, and forceps major (all p < 0.01, all uncorrected). There was no significant difference in rCBF between the early and the advanced stage. In patients with an advanced stage, PCA involvement was correlated with a significantly lower Full Scale IQ (p = 0.036), cingulate volume (p < 0.01, uncorrected), and FA of the left SLF (p = 0.0002, uncorrected) compared to those with an intact PCA. The rCBF was positively correlated with FA of the SLF, IFOF, and forceps major (r > 0.34, p < 0.05). Global gray matter volumes were moderately correlated with TMT part A (r = 0.40, p = 0.003). FA values in the left SLF were moderately associated with processing speed (r = 0.40, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Although hemodynamic compensation may mask cerebral ischemia in advanced stages of adult moyamoya disease, the disease progression is detrimental to gray and white matter microstructure as well as cognition. In particular, additional PCA involvement in advanced disease stages may impair key neural substrates such as the cingulum and SLF. Thus, combined structural MRI and DTI are potentially useful for tracking the neural integrity of key neural substrates associated with cognitive function and detecting subtle anatomical changes associated with persistent ischemia, as well as disease progression.\n",

However, whether sex differences exist in the association between social cognition and neurocognition are not known. We aimed to investigate the contribution of areas of neurocognition to theory of mind (ToM) and hostility bias, representing social cognition, according to sex in early course schizophrenia. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we assessed neurocognition using the Japanese version of the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) and assessed the ToM and hostility bias subdomains of social cognition using the Social Cognition Screening Questionnaire (SCSQ) in 131 participants (65 female, 66 male) diagnosed with schizophrenia within 5 years of onset. Sex differences were analyzed using t-tests. The associations of neurocognitive subdomains with ToM and hostility bias according to sex were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. Results were adjusted by age, estimated premorbid intelligence quotient, and symptomatology. RESULTS: No sex differences were found in ToM (p = 0.071) or hostility bias (p = 0.057). Higher verbal fluency was significantly associated with higher ToM in females (p < 0.01), whereas higher executive function was significantly associated with higher ToM in males (p < 0.05). Higher verbal fluency was significantly associated with lower hostility bias in females (p < 0.05), whereas neurocognition and hostility bias were not significantly associated in males. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that neurocognition associated with social cognition differ according to sex. These differences should be considered for more effective treatment of social cognition.\n",

            "Artificial intelligence-based unsupervised deep learning (DL) is widely used to mine multimodal big data. However, there are few applications of this technology to cancer genomics. We aim to develop DL models to extract deep features from the breast cancer gene expression data and copy number alteration (CNA) data separately and jointly. We hypothesize that the deep features are associated with patients' clinical characteristics and outcomes. Two unsupervised denoising autoencoders (DAs) were developed to extract deep features from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) breast cancer gene expression and CNA data separately and jointly. A heat map was used to view and cluster patients into subgroups based on these DL features. Fisher's exact test and Pearson' Chi-square test were applied to test the associations of patients' groups and clinical information. Survival differences between the groups were evaluated by Kaplan(-)Meier (KM) curves. Associations between each of the features and patient's overall survival were assessed using Cox's proportional hazards (COX-PH) model and a risk score for each feature set from the different omics data sets was generated from the survival regression coefficients. The risk scores for each feature set were binarized into high- and low-risk patient groups to evaluate survival differences using KM curves. Furthermore, the risk scores were traced back to their gene level DAs weights so that the three gene lists for each of the genomic data points were generated to perform gene set enrichment analysis. Patients were clustered into two groups based on concatenated features from the gene expression and CNA data and these two groups showed different overall survival rates (p-value = 0.049) and different ER (Estrogen receptor) statuses (p-value = 0.002, OR (odds ratio) = 0.626). All the risk scores from the gene expression and CNA data and their concatenated one were significantly associated with breast cancer survival. The patients with the high-risk group were significantly associated with patients' worse outcomes (p-values </= 0.0023). The concatenated risk score was enriched by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, the regulation of DNA-templated transcription, the regulation of nucleic acid-templated transcription, the regulation of apoptotic process, the positive regulation of gene expression, the positive regulation of cell proliferation, heart morphogenesis, the regulation of cellular macromolecule biosynthetic process, with FDR (false discovery rate) less than 0.05. We confirmed DAs can effectively extract meaningful genomic features from genomic data and concatenating multiple data sources can improve the significance of the features associated with breast cancer patients' clinical characteristics and outcomes.\n",

Improvements in high throughput sequencing have led to the detection of putative risk genetic loci for NNDs, however, quantitative neurogenetic approaches need to be further developed in order to establish causality and underlying molecular genetic mechanisms of pathogenesis. Here, we discuss an approach for prioritizing the contribution of genetic risk loci to complex-NND pathogenesis by estimating the possible impacts of these loci on gene regulation. Furthermore, we highlight the use of a tissue-specificity gene expression index and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the interpretation of the role of genetic risk elements in NND pathogenesis. Given that NND symptoms are associated with brain dysfunction, risk loci with direct, causative actions would comprise genes with essential functions in neural cells that are highly expressed in the brain. Indeed, NND risk genes implicated in brain dysfunction are disproportionately enriched in the brain compared with other tissues, which we refer to as brain-specific expressed genes. In addition, the tissue-specificity gene expression index can be used as a handle to identify non-brain contexts that are involved in NND pathogenesis. Lastly, we discuss how using an AI approach provides the opportunity to integrate the biological impacts of risk loci to identify those putative combinations of causative relationships through which genetic factors contribute to NND pathogenesis.\n",

INTERVENTIONS: Audiologic characteristics measured included side and severity of hearing loss and word recognition scores in quiet and in noise. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive abilities were measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; reading, math, and writing achievement was measured with the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test - Second Edition - Abbreviated; and oral language skills were measured with the Oral Written and Language Scales. RESULTS: Children with unilateral hearing loss had worse verbal cognitive and oral language scores than children with normal hearing, but there were no differences in achievement scores. Children with profound unilateral hearing loss tended to have worse cognitive scores and had significantly lower oral language scores. Higher word recognition scores of the normal hearing ear in quiet were associated with higher cognitive, oral language, and reading achievement scores. Higher word recognition scores in noise were slightly correlated with higher oral language scores. CONCLUSION: As expected, children with unilateral hearing loss had worse language scores than their siblings with normal hearing, with trends toward worse cognitive scores.

STUDY DESIGN: The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) is a cross-sectional survey (1988-1994) that used complex multistage sampling design to produce nationally representative demographic and examination data. METHODS: A total of 4,823 children ages 6 to 16 years completed audiometric evaluation and cognitive testing during NHANES III. Hearing loss was defined as low-frequency pure-tone average (PTA) >25 dB (0.5, 1, 2 kHz) or high-frequency PTA >25 dB (3, 4, 6, 8 kHz) and was designated as unilateral or bilateral. Nonverbal intelligence was measured using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised block design subtest. Low nonverbal intelligence was defined as a standardized score <4, two standard deviations below the standardized mean of 10. RESULTS: Mean nonverbal intelligence scores differed between children with normal hearing (9.59) and children with bilateral (6.87; P = .02) but not unilateral (9.12; P = .42) hearing loss. Non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity and family income <$20,000 were associated with 3.92 and 1.67 times higher odds of low nonverbal intelligence, respectively (odds ratio [OR]: 3.92; P < .001; OR: 1.67; P = .02). Bilateral hearing loss was independently associated with 5.77 times increased odds of low nonverbal intelligence compared to normal hearing children (OR: 5.77; P = .02). Unilateral hearing loss was not associated with higher odds of low nonverbal intelligence (OR: 0.73; P = .40). CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral but not unilateral hearing loss is associated with decreased nonverbal intelligence in US children. Longitudinal studies are urgently needed to better understand these associations and their potential impact on future opportunities.\n",

            "OBJECTIVE: In the past, it was believed that unilateral hearing loss has a minimal impact on the speech and language development in children. However, several studies have suggested that some school-age children with unilateral hearing loss have learning impairments in language. In the present study, we first examined whether preschool-age children with unilateral severe-to-profound hearing loss (UHL) have delays in the development of receptive vocabulary and verbal intelligence. In the follow-up study, we tested the children again after school admission. The objective of the present study was to reveal the development of receptive vocabulary and verbal intelligence from preschool to school years in children with UHL. METHODS: Fifteen Japanese preschool-age children with UHL and a control group of 20 age-matched Japanese children with bilateral normal hearing (NH), who were examined because articulation disorder was suspected, were enrolled in this study. The development of receptive vocabulary and verbal intelligence was evaluated using the Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PVT-R) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale, respectively. The present retrospective study was approved by the Committee for Medical Ethics of Tokushima University Hospital (#3801). RESULTS: The scaled score (SS) of the PVT-R and verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ)/verbal comprehension index (VCI), but not performance intelligence quotient/perceptual reasoning index in children with UHL were significantly lower than those in the control children with NH at preschool-age. The SS of the PVT-R and VIQ/VCI in children with UHL significantly improved after school admission. In the subgroup analysis, the SS of the PVT-R in the lower receptive vocabulary group of children with UHL at preschool-age was significantly increased after school admission, but the SS in the normal and higher receptive vocabulary group of children with UHL at preschool-age were still around the standardized mean of SS after school admission. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the development of receptive vocabulary and verbal intelligence was delayed in preschool-age children with UHL and that most of them caught up to exhibit normal language ability after school admission.\n",

            "PURPOSE: In the context of music and speech perception, this study aimed to assess the effect of variation in one of two auditory attributes-pitch contour and timbre-on the perception of the other in prelingually deafened young cochlear implant (CI) users, and the relationship between pitch contour perception and two cognitive functions of interest. METHOD: Nine prelingually deafened CI users, aged 8.75-22.17 years, completed a melodic contour identification (MCI) task using stimuli of piano notes or sung speech with a fixed timbre (same word for each note) or a mixed timbre (different words for each note), a speech perception task identifying matrix-styled sentences naturally intonated or sung with a fixed pitch (same pitch for each word) or a mixed pitch (different pitches for each word), a forward digit span test indexing auditory short-term memory (STM), and the matrices section of the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test-Second Edition indexing nonverbal IQ. RESULTS: MCI was significantly poorer for the mixed timbre condition. Speech perception was significantly poorer for the fixed and mixed pitch conditions than for the naturally intonated condition. Auditory STM positively correlated with MCI at 2- and 3-semitone note spacings. Relative to their normal-hearing peers from a related study using the same stimuli and tasks, the CI participants showed comparable MCI at 2- or 3-semitone note spacing, and a comparable level of significant decrement in speech perception across three pitch contour conditions. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that prelingually deafened CI users show similar trends of normal-hearing peers for the effect of variation in pitch contour or timbre on the perception of the other, and that cognitive functions may underlie these outcomes to some extent, at least for the perception of pitch contour.

However, the implications of these comorbidities for cochlear implant placement have been not fully established. This study sought to identify these implications by comparing developmental delays among children with these conditions. METHODS: Participants were children who were followed up at least every 6 months for 24 months after cochlear implant surgery. Developmental delays were assessed using the Enjoji Scale of Infant Analytical Development (Enjoji Scale) and compared in three groups with hearing loss: those with ID (ID group, n=4); those with ASD and ID (ASD+ID group, n=4); and those with typical development (control group, n=5). Developmental delay was evaluated longitudinally before and after cochlear implant placement for 18 months. RESULTS: Among the six subscales that make up the Enjoji Scale, language development and intelligence development were significantly delayed in all three groups and were exacerbated over time except for language development in the control group. Emotional development and social behavior were significantly delayed only in the ASD+ID group. Comparison of intergroup differences revealed delays in language development in the ID and ASD+ID groups compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: The Enjoji Scale successfully demonstrated developmental delays characteristic to the underlying comorbidities of ID with or without ASD in children with cochlear implants. The Enjoji Scale can be a useful diagnostic tool for screening children with cochlear implants for ID with or without ASD.\n",

            "OBJECTIVE: A cochlear implant is a device that helps hearing-impaired children by transmitting sound signals to the brain and helping them improve their speech, language, and social interaction. Although various studies have investigated the different aspects of speech perception and language acquisition in cochlear-implanted children, little is known about their social skills, particularly Persian-speaking cochlear-implanted children. Considering the growing number of cochlear implants being performed in Iran and the increasing importance of developing near-normal social skills as one of the ultimate goals of cochlear implantation, this study was performed to compare the social interaction between Iranian cochlear-implanted children who have undergone rehabilitation (auditory verbal therapy) after surgery and normal-hearing children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive-analytical study compared the social interaction level of 30 children with normal hearing and 30 with cochlear implants who were conveniently selected. The Raven test was administered to the both groups to ensure normal intelligence quotient. The social interaction status of both groups was evaluated using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, and statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21. RESULTS: After controlling age as a covariate variable, no significant difference was observed between the social interaction scores of both the groups (p > 0.05). In addition, social interaction had no correlation with sex in either group. CONCLUSION: Cochlear implantation followed by auditory verbal rehabilitation helps children with sensorineural hearing loss to have normal social interactions, regardless of their sex.\n",

            "BACKGROUND/AIM: Over the last 10 years more than 300 persons received cochlear implant in Serbia and more than 90% of the recipients were children under 10 years of age. The program of cochlear implantation includes postoperative rehabilitation in which cognitive, integrative and developmental methods are used. The study was conducted to reveal factors affecting communication performance (CP) of cochlear implanted (Cl) children. Special attention was focused on the influence of the duration and intensity of rehabilitation and hearing age on further development of communication skills. METHODS: A group of 30 CI children (13 boys and 17 girls) aged 2 to 5 years was enrolled in the study. All of the children had average intelligence and no other developmental disorder. They lived in families and attended rehabilitative seances 3 to 5 times a week. Their parents/caregivers answered structured questionnaire about functioning after pediatric cochlear implantation (FAPCI) and the results were the subject of detailed statistical analysis. RESULTS: Analysis of variance did not show any difference between the boys and the girls regarding FAPCI achievements (F(1, 28) = 2.909; p = 0.099) and age aberration in CP score (F(1,28) = 0.114, p = 0.738). Correlation analysis showed a statistically significant difference in FAPCI scores related to hearing age and duration of rehabilitation. Regression analysis (enter method) showed that model consisting of indipendent variables significantly contributed to prediction of overall FAPCI scores and Adjusted R2 value could explain 32% difference in communication skills of participants in this study. CONCLUSION: Communication skills of CI children evaluated by FAPCI are falling behind normatives for normal hearing children 18.6 months on the average. Hearing age, duration and intensity of rehabilitation have positive predictive value for communication skills development. Later identification of hearing loss and later cochlear implantation lead to delayed development of communication skills.\n",

Few studies have examined the effect of maternal and infant micronutrient supplementation on development outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We conducted a follow-up study of two randomized trials of antenatal and infant micronutrient supplementation conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We assessed the effect of maternal multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation in pregnancy on development of children at 11-14 years of age. We also examined the effect of infant zinc and MMN supplementation on development at 6-8 years of age. We used generalized linear models to assess standardized mean differences (SMDs) in general intelligence, executive function, and mental health scores. RESULTS: We followed up 446 children whose mothers were enrolled in the maternal MMN supplementation trial and 365 children who were enrolled in the infant zinc and MMN supplementation trial. We found no effect of maternal MMN supplementation on general intelligence (SMD: -0.03; 95% CI: -0.15, 0.09), executive function (SMD: 0.00; 95% CI: -0.11, 0.11), and mental health scores (SMD: 0.06; 95% CI: 10.10, 0.22). We also found no effect of either infant zinc or MMN supplementation on any of the three development domains (p-values > 0.05).

            "In developing countries, deficiencies of micronutrients are thought to have a major impact on child development; however, a consensus on the specific relationship between dietary zinc intake and cognitive function remains elusive. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the relationship between zinc intake, status and indices of cognitive function in children and adults. A systematic literature search was conducted using EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases from inception to March 2014. Included studies were those that supplied zinc as supplements or measured dietary zinc intake. A meta-analysis of the extracted data was performed where sufficient data were available. Of all of the potentially relevant papers, 18 studies met the inclusion criteria, 12 of which were randomised controlled trials (RCTs; 11 in children and 1 in adults) and 6 were observational studies (2 in children and 4 in adults). Nine of the 18 studies reported a positive association between zinc intake or status with one or more measure of cognitive function. Meta-analysis of data from the adult's studies was not possible because of limited number of studies. A meta-analysis of data from the six RCTs conducted in children revealed that there was no significant overall effect of zinc intake on any indices of cognitive function: intelligence, standard mean difference of <0.001 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.12, 0.13) P=0.95; executive function, standard mean difference of 0.08 (95% CI, -0.06, 022) P=0.26; and motor skills standard mean difference of 0.11 (95% CI -0.17, 0.39) P=0.43. Heterogeneity in the study designs was a major limitation, hence only a small number (n=6) of studies could be included in the meta-analyses. Meta-analysis failed to show a significant effect of zinc supplementation on cognitive functioning in children though, taken as a whole, there were some small indicators of improvement on aspects of executive function and motor development following supplementation but high-quality RCTs are necessary to investigate this further.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: The effect of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) intake on cognitive development is controversial. Most randomized trials have assessed cognition at 18 mo, although significant development of cognitive abilities (early executive function) emerge later. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate cognition beyond 18 mo and longitudinal cognitive change from 18 mo to 6 y in children who were fed variable amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (0.32%, 0.64%, and 0.96% of total fatty acids) and arachidonic acid (ARA; 0.64%) compared with children who were not fed LCPUFA as infants. DESIGN: Eighty-one children (19 placebo, 62 LCPUFA) who participated in a double-blind, randomized trial of LCPUFA supplementation as infants were re-enrolled at 18 mo and tested every 6 mo until 6 y on age-appropriate standardized and specific cognitive tests. RESULTS: LCPUFA supplementation did not influence performance on standardized tests of language and performance at 18 mo; however, significant positive effects were observed from 3 to 5 y on rule-learning and inhibition tasks, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test at 5 y, and the Weschler Primary Preschool Scales of Intelligence at 6 y. Effects of LCPUFAs were not found on tasks of spatial memory, simple inhibition, or advanced problem solving. CONCLUSIONS: The data from this relatively small trial suggest that, although the effects of LCPUFAs may not always be evident on standardized developmental tasks at 18 mo, significant effects may emerge later on more specific or fine-grained tasks. The results imply that studies of nutrition and cognitive development should be powered to continue through early childhood. This parent trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00266825.\n",

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate whether and to what extent the associations between adverse birth outcomes and cognitive development in mid-childhood and early adolescence are mediated by postnatal stature. METHODS: We used data from a prospective birth cohort of children born to women who participated in a large cluster-randomized trial of antenatal micronutrient supplementation in rural western China. Children were followed up for anthropometric assessments at 6, 12, and 24 mo of age and in mid-childhood (7-9 y). Cognitive development was assessed in mid-childhood (n = 669) and early adolescence (n = 735; 10-12 y) using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV. We conducted a causal mediation analysis to evaluate the proportion of the association of low birth weight (LBW; <2500 g), small-for-gestational age (SGA; <10th percentile), and preterm birth (<37 weeks of gestation) with cognitive development in mid-childhood and early adolescence that was mediated by postnatal length/height-for-age and -sex z score (LAZ/HAZ) during the first 2 y of life and in mid-childhood. RESULTS: LBW and SGA, but not preterm birth, were associated with lower cognitive test scores in mid-childhood and early adolescence. The proportion of the total association of SGA with adolescent cognitive development that was mediated by LAZ/HAZ at 6, 12, and 24 mo of age and in mid-childhood was 25%, 32%, 32%, and 27%, respectively. The corresponding proportions for LBW were 25%, 32%, 16%, and 24%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The association of LBW and SGA with cognitive development in mid-childhood and adolescence is not largely mediated by postnatal stature during the first 2 y of life. Postnatal interventions that address the antecedent causes of poor child growth and development, rather than early childhood growth alone, are more likely to mitigate the risk of suboptimal development among SGA and LBW children.

This cross-sectional study was performed on 200 nursing staff of a hospital in Iran. To collect data, individuals were asked to complete several questionnaires, including demographic questionnaire, domain-specific risk-taking questionnaire, Rosenberg self-confidence questionnaire, Buss-Perry aggression questionnaire, Goleman emotional intelligence questionnaire, and safe behavior questionnaire. Also, the number of needlestick injuries in the participants was extracted from their medical records. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software (version 22), and path analysis was performed using AMOS software. The prevalence of needle stick injuries in the subjects was estimated by 45.5 percent. The results showed that increasing risk-taking, increasing aggression, decreasing self-confidence, and decreasing emotional intelligence reduced safe behavior and increased the number of needle injuries (P < 0.001). In the present study, some personal traits affecting the occurrence of needlestick injuries were identified. It is recommended that people without these negative traits are applied in dangerous occupations with a high probability of needle stick injuries.\n",

            "Neuropathological and clinical evidence indicates that the clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs as neuropathology exceeds the brain reserve capacity. The brain or cognitive reserve (BCR) hypothesis states that high premorbid intelligence, education, and an active and stimulating lifestyle provide reserve capacity, which acts as a buffer against the cognitive deficits due to accumulating neuropathology. Neuroimaging studies that assessed the BCR hypothesis are critically reviewed with emphasis on study design and statistical analysis. Many studies were performed in the last two decades owing to the increasing availability of positron emission tomography (PET) and PET/computed tomography scanners and to the synthesis of new radiopharmaceuticals, including tracers for amyloid and tau proteins. Studies with different tracers provided complementary consistent results supporting the BCR hypothesis. Many studies were appropriately designed with a measure of reserve, a measure of brain anatomy/function/neuropathology, and a measure of cognitive functions that are necessary. Most of the early studies were performed with PET and [ (18) F]fluorodeoxyglucose, and occasionally with [ (15) O]water, reporting a significant association between higher occupation/education and lower glucose metabolism (blood flow) in associative temporo-parietal cortex in patients with AD and also in patients with MCI, after correcting for the degree in the cognitive impairment. On the contrary, performances on several neuropsychological tests increased with increasing education for participants with elevated [ (11) C]PiB uptake. Studies with the tracers specific for tau protein showed that patients with AD with elevated tau deposits had higher cognitive performances compared with patients with similar levels of tau deposits. BCR in AD is also associated with a preserved cholinergic function. The BCR hypothesis has been validated with methodologically sound study designs and sophisticated neuroimaging techniques using different radiotracers and providing an explanation for neuropathological and clinical observations on patients with AD.\n",

Here, we report a walking stick powered by ultra-low-frequency human motion and equipped with deep-learning-enabled advanced sensing features to provide a healthcare-monitoring platform for motion-impaired users. A linear-to-rotary structure is designed to achieve highly efficient energy harvesting from the linear motion of a walking stick with ultralow frequency. Besides, two kinds of self-powered triboelectric sensors are proposed and integrated to extract the motion features of the walking stick. Augmented sensing functionalities with high accuracies have been enabled by deep-learning-based data analysis, including identity recognition, disability evaluation, and motion status distinguishing. Furthermore, a self-sustainable Internet of Things (IoT) system with global positioning system tracing and environmental temperature and humidity amenity sensing functions is obtained. Combined with the aforementioned functionalities, this walking stick is demonstrated in various usage scenarios as a caregiver for real-time well-being status and activity monitoring. The caregiving walking stick shows the potential of being an intelligent aid for motion-impaired users to help them live life with adequate autonomy and safety.\n",

            "OBJECTIVE: Structural brain differences are found in adults and children with epilepsy, yet pediatric samples have been heterogeneous regarding seizure type, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, and hemisphere of seizure focus. This study examines whether cortical thickness and surface area differ between children with left-hemisphere focal epilepsy (LHE) and age-matched typically developing (TD) peers. We examined whether age differentially moderated cortical thickness between groups and if cortical thickness was associated with duration of epilepsy, seizure frequency, or neuropsychological functioning. METHODS: Thirty-five children with LHE and 35 TD children completed neuropsychological testing and 3T MR imaging. Neuropsychological measures included general intelligence and executive functioning. All MRIs were normal. Surface-based morphometric processing and analyses were conducted using FreeSurfer 6.0. Regression analyses compared age by cortical thickness differences between groups. Correlational analyses examined associations between cortical thickness in these areas with neuropsychological functioning or epilepsy characteristics. RESULTS: Left-hemisphere focal epilepsy displayed decreased cortical thickness bilaterally compared to TD controls across 6 brain regions but no differences in surface area. Moderation analyses revealed quadratic relationships between age and cortical thickness for left frontoparietal-cingulate and right superior frontal regions. Higher performance intelligence quotient (IQ) (PIQ) and verbal IQ (VIQ) and fewer parent reported executive function problems were associated with greater cortical thickness in TD children. SIGNIFICANCE: Children with LHE displayed thinner cortex extending beyond the hemisphere of seizure focus. The nonlinear pattern of cortical thickness across age occurring in TD children is not evident in the same manner in children with LHE. These differences in cortical thickness patterns were greatest in children 8-12 years old. Greater cortical thickness was associated with higher IQ and fewer executive control problems in daily activities in TD children. Thus, differences in cortical thickness in the absence of differences in surface area, suggest cortical thickness may be a sensitive proxy of subtle neuroanatomical changes that are related to neuropsychological functioning.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to air pollution disrupts cognitive, emotional, and behavioral development. The brain disturbances associated with prenatal air pollution are largely unknown. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we estimated prenatal exposures to fine particulate matter (PM(2.5) ) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and then assessed their associations with measures of brain anatomy, tissue microstructure, neurometabolites, and blood flow in 332 youth, 6-14 years old. We then assessed how those brain disturbances were associated with measures of intelligence, ADHD and anxiety symptoms, and socialization. RESULTS: Both exposures were associated with thinning of dorsal parietal cortices and thickening of postero-inferior and mesial wall cortices. They were associated with smaller white matter volumes, reduced organization in white matter of the internal capsule and frontal lobe, higher metabolite concentrations in frontal cortex, reduced cortical blood flow, and greater microstructural organization in subcortical gray matter nuclei. Associations were stronger for PM(2.5) in boys and PAH in girls. Youth with low exposure accounted for most significant associations of ADHD, anxiety, socialization, and intelligence measures with cortical thickness and white matter volumes, whereas it appears that high exposures generally disrupted these neurotypical brain-behavior associations, likely because strong exposure-related effects increased the variances of these brain measures. CONCLUSIONS: The commonality of effects across exposures suggests PM(2.5) and PAH disrupt brain development through one or more common molecular pathways, such as inflammation or oxidative stress. Progressively higher exposures were associated with greater disruptions in local volumes, tissue organization, metabolite concentrations, and blood flow throughout cortical and subcortical brain regions and the white matter pathways interconnecting them. Together these affected regions comprise cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, which support the regulation of thought, emotion, and behavior.\n",

We therefore evaluated the neurodevelopment of our cohort during the prepubertal period and in adolescence. At prepubertal age (7-12 years) 41 children were tested. Both neuromotor functioning and psychological testing were performed (Dutch version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-R) and the Dutch version of the Child Behavior Checklist for ages 4-18 years (CBCL 4-18) and the Teacher Report Form (TRF)). Neurophysiological tests were performed using magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography. In adolescence (14-18 years) the behavior of 33 children was studied again (CBCL and TRF). And the levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) were measured in serum. RESULTS: At prepubertal age no association was found between perinatal dioxin exposure and verbal, performal and total IQ or with the Touwen's test for neuromotor development. There were behavioral problems associated with both prenatal and postnatal dioxin exposure. In adolescence there were problems associated with the current dioxin levels and dioxin-like-PCBs. Neurophysiological tests revealed clear negative dysfunction. An increase in latency time after a motion stimulus (N2b) of 13 ms (= a delay of 10%) is associated with the higher prenatal dioxin exposure. A similar delay was measured in testing cognitive ability by analyzing the odd ball measurements, N200 and P300, together with an amplitude decrease of 12 %. The delay is indicative of a defective myelinisation and the decrease in amplitude of a loss of neurons. CONCLUSION: We found effects on behavior in association with the perinatal dioxin exposure and in adolescence in association with the current dioxin levels. Neurophysiological testing is instrumental in the detection of effects of perinatal background levels of chemicals on brain development in normal, healthy children. The clinical, neurological and psychological tests commonly used are not sensitive enough to detect important effects.\n",

We studied intelligence quotient (IQ) or developmental quotient (DQ) values and their change after epilepsy surgery in a consecutive series of 42 children (median age at surgery: 4.5, range: 0-17.0 years) with refractory epilepsy due to mMCD/FCD. Cognitive impairment, defined as IQ/DQ below 70, was present in 51% prior to surgery. Cognitive impairment was associated with earlier onset of epilepsy, longer epilepsy duration, and FCD type I histology. Clinically relevant improvement of >/=10 IQ/DQ points was found in 24% of children and was related to the presence of presurgical epileptic encephalopathy (EE). At time of postsurgical cognitive testing, 59% of children were completely seizure-free (Engel 1A).

            "Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive multisystem disorder featuring cerebellar ataxia, early-onset cataracts, chronic myopathy, variable intellectual disability and delayed motor development. More recently, mutations in the SIL1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum resident co-chaperone, were identified as the main cause of Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome. Here we describe the results of SIL1 mutation analysis in 62 patients presenting with early-onset ataxia, cataracts and myopathy or combinations of at least two of these. We obtained a mutation detection rate of 60% (15/25) among patients with the characteristic Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome triad (ataxia, cataracts, myopathy) whereas the detection rate in the group of patients with more variable phenotypic presentation was below 3% (1/37). We report 16 unrelated families with a total of 19 different SIL1 mutations. Among these mutations are 15 previously unreported changes, including single- and multi-exon deletions. Based on data from our screening cohort and data compiled from the literature we found that SIL1 mutations are invariably associated with the combination of a cerebellar syndrome and chronic myopathy. Cataracts were observed in all patients beyond the age of 7 years, but might be missing in infants. Six patients with SIL1 mutations had no intellectual disability, extending the known wide range of cognitive capabilities in Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome to include normal intelligence. Modestly constant features were somatic growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities and pyramidal tract signs. Examination of mutant SIL1 expression in cultured patient lymphoblasts suggested that SIL1 mutations result in severely reduced SIL1 protein levels irrespective of the type and position of mutations. Our data broaden the SIL1 mutation spectrum and confirm that SIL1 is the major Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome gene. SIL1 patients usually present with the characteristic triad but cataracts might be missing in young children. As cognitive impairment is not obligatory, patients without intellectual disability but a Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome-compatible phenotype should receive SIL1 mutation analysis. Despite allelic heterogeneity and many families with private mutations, the phenotype related to SIL1 mutations is relatively homogenous. Based on SIL1 expression studies we speculate that this may arise from a uniform effect of different mutations on protein expression.\n",

In 2019, our laboratory reported an improved surgical sepsis model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) that provides additional daily chronic stress (DCS), as well as adhering to the Minimum Quality Threshold in Pre-Clinical Sepsis Studies (MQTiPSS) guidelines. This model phenotypically recapitulates the persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome observed in adult human surgical sepsis survivors. Whether these phenotypic similarities between septic humans and mice are replicated at the circulating blood leukocyte transcriptome has not been demonstrated. Our analysis, in contrast with previous findings, demonstrated that genome-wide expression in our new murine model more closely approximated human surgical sepsis patients, particularly in the more chronic phases of sepsis. Importantly, our new model of murine surgical sepsis with chronic stress did not reflect well gene expression patterns from humans with community-acquired sepsis. Our work indicates that improved preclinical murine sepsis modeling can better replicate both the phenotypic and transcriptomic responses to surgical sepsis, but cannot be extrapolated to other sepsis etiologies. Importantly, these improved models can be a useful adjunct to human-focused and artificial intelligence-based forms of research in order to improve septic patients' morbidity and mortality.\n",

RESULTS: The IQ range was from 54 to 92. The main weaknesses related to three domains: static and dynamic postural control, visuospatio-constructive abilities, and both sequential processing and selective attention. The main strengths were in holistic perception, semantic competencies, logical reasoning and planning skills, with axial and peripheral hypotonia.

Furthermore, both KBG and the 16q24.3 microdeletion syndromes show clinical findings reminiscent of Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), an imprinting disorder characterized by severe primordial growth retardation. In a cohort of patients referred as SRS, we previously identified a 16q24.3 deletion, but at that time, only patients with larger imbalances in 16q24.3 and intellectual disability had been published.

We examined the cross-sectional associations of score on the vocabulary test of the Groningen Intelligence Test with: 1) determinants of diabetic complications (HbA(1c) , blood pressure and lipid level); 2) diabetic complications: chronic kidney disease, neuropathic pain, self-reported history of cardiovascular disease and carotid intima-media thickness; and 3) walking speed. Analyses were performed using linear regression and adjusted in separate models for potential confounders and mediators. Significant age- and sex-adjusted associations were additionally adjusted for educational level in a separate model. RESULTS: After full adjustment, lower verbal intelligence was associated with the presence of neuropathic pain [odds ratio (OR) 1.18, 95% CI 1.02;1.36], cardiovascular disease (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01;1.30), and slower walking speed (regression coefficient -0.011 m/s, 95% CI -0.021; -0.002 m/s).

            "AIMS: To determine if children and young people aged < 23 years with Type 1 diabetes differ in academic ability from age-matched control subjects without Type 1 diabetes and whether academic scores are related to glycaemic control. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, we administered cognitive and academic tests (Woodcock-Johnson III Spatial Relations, General Information, Letter-Word Recognition, Calculation and Spelling tests) to young people with Type 1 diabetes (n=61) and control subjects (n=26) aged 9-22 years. The groups did not differ in age or gender. Participants with Type 1 diabetes had a disease duration of 5-17.7 years. History of glycaemic control (HbA1c , diabetic ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycaemic episodes) was obtained via medical records and interviews. RESULTS: The participants with Type 1 diabetes had a lower mean estimated verbal intelligence (IQ) level compared with those in the control group (P=0.04). Greater exposure to hyperglycaemia over time was associated with lower spelling abilities within the group with Type 1 diabetes (P=0.048), even after controlling for age, gender, socio-economic status, blood glucose level at time of testing and verbal IQ (P=0.01). History of severe hypoglycaemia or ketoacidosis was not associated with differences in academic abilities. CONCLUSIONS: In children and young people, Type 1 diabetes was associated with a lower verbal IQ. Moreover, increased exposure to hyperglycaemia was associated with lower spelling performance. These results imply that hyperglycaemia can affect cognitive function and/or learning processes that may affect academic achievement.\n",

            "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there were diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) changes in the brain among children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) and investigate the correlation between the fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and neurocognitive functions. METHODS: 35 children with Type 1 DM and 21 age-matched healthy control subjects were included. Neurocognitive functions of subjects with Type 1 DM were evaluated. In both groups, FA and ADC values were calculated in 20 different locations. The association between neurocognitive function tests and FA and ADC values was investigated. RESULTS: Subjects with diabetes had significant changes in FA and ADC values in widespread brain regions compared with the healthy control group. ADC values in the caudate nucleus were negatively associated with verbal point. Increased ADC values in the genu of the corpus callosum were positively associated with Stroop test. There was a negative correlation between the ADC values of the parietal white matter and the judgment of line orientation test. FA values of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus were positively correlated with performance point. However, a negative correlation was noted between FA values of mid-brain and intelligence quotient level as well as another negative correlation between FA values of the posterior crus of the internal capsule and thalamus with verbal point. CONCLUSION: Subjects with diabetes demonstrated significant changes in FA and ADC values in widespread brain regions, and such changes could be early features of injury to myelinated fibres or axonal degeneration. Our findings suggest that brain damage may have begun at the cellular level in the initial stage of Type 1 diabetes and neurocognitive impairments may be inevitable. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: DTI can demonstrate ADC and FA changes which are well correlated with neurocognitive dysfunction in the brains of children with Type 1 DM. This may help us in guiding preventive measures in early period of the disease before deterioration of neurocognitive functions.\n",

            "OBJECTIVES: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is strongly associated with cognitive impairment but the factors within T2DM that predispose to cognitive impairment are less well understood, while previous studies have investigated samples with T2DM of widely varying duration. We aimed to investigate the factors associated with cognitive impairment in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. METHOD: In a multi-ethnic sample with T2DM diagnosed in the last 6 months, we assessed cognitive function using the 13-item modified telephone interview for cognitive status (TICS-M). Cognitive function was assessed both categorically (impairment defined as lowest 10% of scores with the remainder as controls) and as continuous TICS-M score. Its associations were tested in univariate and multivariate analyses with a range of biological, psychological and sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: Of 1790 participants, 1680 had a complete TICS-M assessment at baseline. After controlling for covariates, older age (p < 0.001) and lower verbal intelligence (p < 0.001) were associated with both cognitive impairment and lower TICS-M scores, while non-white ethnicity (p < 0.001), female gender (p = 0.02) and higher HbA1c (p = 0.002) were associated with lower TICS-M scores. Depression (defined as Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score >/=10), elevated inflammatory markers and body mass index were not associated with cognitive function after controlling for covariates. CONCLUSION: Age, verbal intelligence, female gender and HbA1c are associated with cognitive performance in T2DM soon after diagnosis. Previously reported associations with depression and inflammatory markers may occur later as causes or consequences of T2DM. Longitudinal analyses are needed to assess potentially modifiable factors predicting cognitive decline in early T2DM.\n",

However, the effect of dietary intake on hippocampal-dependent memory during childhood has remained unexamined. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the cross-sectional relation of dietary components characteristic of the Western diet, including saturated fatty acids (SFAs), omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids, and refined sugar, with hippocampal-dependent relational memory in prepubescent children. DESIGN: Participants aged 7-9 y (n = 52) reported their dietary intake by using the Youth-Adolescent Food-Frequency Questionnaire and completed memory tasks designed to assess relational (hippocampal-dependent) and item (hippocampal-independent) memory. Performance on the memory tasks was assessed with both direct (accuracy) and indirect (eye movement) measures. RESULTS: Partial correlations adjusted for body mass index showed a positive relation between relational memory accuracy and intake of omega-3 fatty acids and a negative relation of both relational and item memory accuracy with intake of SFAs. Potential confounding factors of age, sex, intelligence quotient, socioeconomic status, pubertal timing, and aerobic fitness (maximal oxygen volume) were not significantly related to any of the dietary intake measures. Eye movement measures of relational memory (preferential viewing to the target stimulus) showed a negative relation with intake of added sugar. CONCLUSIONS: SFA intake was negatively associated with both forms of memory, whereas omega-3 fatty acid intake was selectively positively associated with hippocampal-dependent relational memory. These findings are among the first to show a link between habitual dietary intake and cognitive health as pertaining to hippocampal function in childhood.

            "INTRODUCTION: To further investigate manifestations of episodic memory impairments in adolescents, we examined the role of encoding on recognition of stimuli in conditions designed to emphasize their item-specific versus relational characteristics in a group of 12-18 year olds with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We also examined how strategic learning and memory processes, verbal abilities, attention, and age were associated with recognition in this group. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Twenty two high functioning adolescents with ASD (mean age=15 years; SD=1.8; range=12.2-17.9), and 26 age, gender, and IQ-matched adolescents with typical development (TYP) (mean age=14.7 years; SD=1.9; range=12.3-17.8) completed the Relational and Item-Specific Encoding task (RiSE), the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C), the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence, and the Connors' Parent Rating Scale-Revised. Univariate statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: The ASD group showed poorer performance on strategic memory assessed by the CVLT-C. Surprisingly, on the RiSE, ASD showed poorer discriminability for objects encoded in item-specific versus relational encoding conditions and were more impaired in familiarity (after relational encoding) than in recollection. ASD also did not show the hypothesized association between item and associative recognition and CVLT-C performance found in TYP. Instead, in the ASD group recognition was associated with increased age. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the RiSE task demonstrated that adolescents with ASD do not always exhibit impaired memory for relational information as commonly believed. Instead, memory was worse when cognitive control demands were high, when encoding focused on specific item features, and when familiarity was used to retrieve relational information. Recognition also was better in older participants. This suggests that learning and memory deficits in adolescents with ASD, may not be due primarily to failed relational binding processes in the hippocampus but, rather to disrupted strategic memory and familiarity processes associated with the prefrontal and perirhinal cortices. These findings demonstrate the importance and utility of using well-validated cognitive neuroscience tasks and of considering the ages of participants when comparing the neural underpinnings of different memory processes in both typical and atypical populations.\n",

This study aimed to determine whether the degree of adherence to complementary feeding guidelines was associated with dietary, obesity, cardiovascular, and cognitive outcomes at 7-8 y of age. Data were analyzed from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children using parent-completed dietary questionnaires at 6 mo of age to calculate a Complementary Feeding Utility Index score. Regression analysis was used to explore associations between the index score and dietary patterns derived via principal component analysis (n = 4326), body-mass index (BMI) (n = 4801), waist circumference (n = 4798), blood pressure (n = 4685), and lipids (n = 3232) measured at age 7 y; and intelligence quotient (IQ) measured at age 8 y (n = 4429) after adjustment for covariates. The index score was negatively associated with a \"processed\" dietary pattern (beta = -0.16; 95% CI: -0.20, -0.13; P < 0.001) but positively associated with a \"health conscious\" dietary pattern [beta = 0.18 (95% CI: 0.14, 0.21); P < 0.001]. A higher index score was also positively associated with total, verbal, and performance IQ scores at 8 y of age [beta = 1.92 (95%CI: 1.38, 2.47); P < 0.001 for total IQ). The index score was weakly associated with waist circumference [beta = -0.15 (95%CI: -0.31, -0.002); P = 0.046] and diastolic blood pressure [beta = -0.24 (95%CI: -0.47, -0.01); P = 0.043] at 7 y of age but was not associated with BMI or other cardiovascular risk factors.

            "BACKGROUND: It is well known that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) had executive functions deficit. However, it is still unclear whether the poor dietary quality is related to the impairment of executive functions. The current study aimed to explore the association between dietary quality and executive functions in children with ASD. METHODS: A total of 106 children with ASD (7.7 +/- 1.3 years) and 207 typically developing (TD) children (7.8 +/- 1.3 years) were enrolled from Guangzhou, China. The Chinese version of Behavior Rating Scale of Executive function (BRIEF), the working memory subscales of the Chinese version of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV), and the Stroop Color-Word Test (SCWT) were used to measure the participant's executive functions. The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to collect the dietary intake information, and the Chinese Diet Balance Index (DBI_16) was used to evaluate the dietary quality. Generalized linear models were used to estimate the association between dietary quality and executive functions. RESULTS: In children with ASD, Low Bound Score (LBS) was positively correlated with the working memory subscale score of BRIEF (beta = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.02-0.44, P < 0.05), while High Bound Score (HBS) and LBS were positively correlated with the organizable subscale score of BRIEF (beta = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.11-0.77, P < 0.01; beta = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.01-0.37, P < 0.05). Compared to TD children, children with ASD had a higher proportion of moderate and high levels of insufficient dietary intake (moderate level, 37.7% vs. 23.2%, high level, 4.7% vs. 1.4%) and moderate level of unbalanced dietary intake (36.8% vs.21.3%), higher scores on all subscales of BRIEF (P < 0.01), and lower score on the working memory (81.3 +/- 32.3 vs. 104.6 +/- 12.5, P < 0.01), while there was no difference on the SCWT. CONCLUSION: Poor dietary quality was associated with the impairment of working memory and organizational capacity in children with ASD.

This study investigated the potential influence of fluid intelligence and processing speed on the selective age-related decline in proactive control. Eighty young and 80 healthy older adults were included in this study. The participants were submitted to a working memory recognition paradigm, assessing proactive and reactive cognitive control by manipulating the interference level across items. RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVAs and hierarchical linear regressions indicated that the ability to appropriately use cognitive control processes during aging seems to be at least partially affected by the amount of available cognitive resources (assessed by fluid intelligence and processing speed abilities).

            "\n",
            "Several studies have demonstrated that individual differences in processing speed fully mediate the association between age and intelligence, whereas the association between processing speed and intelligence cannot be explained by age differences. Because measures of processing speed reflect a plethora of cognitive and motivational processes, it cannot be determined which specific processes give rise to this mediation effect. This makes it hard to decide whether these processes should be conceived of as a cause or an indicator of cognitive aging. In the present study, we addressed this question by using a neurocognitive psychometrics approach to decompose the association between age differences and fluid intelligence. Reanalyzing data from two previously published datasets containing 223 participants between 18 and 61 years, we investigated whether individual differences in diffusion model parameters and in ERP latencies associated with higher-order attentional processing explained the association between age differences and fluid intelligence. We demonstrate that individual differences in the speed of non-decisional processes such as encoding, response preparation, and response execution, and individual differences in latencies of ERP components associated with higher-order cognitive processes explained the negative association between age differences and fluid intelligence. Because both parameters jointly accounted for the association between age differences and fluid intelligence, age-related differences in both parameters may reflect age-related differences in anterior brain regions associated with response planning that are prone to be affected by age-related changes. Conversely, age differences did not account for the association between processing speed and fluid intelligence.

This finding has prompted the suggestion that dedifferentiation contributes to age-related cognitive decline. Consistent with this possibility, dedifferentiation has been reported to negatively correlate with fluid intelligence in older adults. Here, we examined whether dedifferentiation is associated with performance in another cognitive domain-episodic memory-that is also highly vulnerable to aging.\n",

            "General cognitive status (GCS) is a composite of cognitive abilities reflecting full function. The literature suggests a relationship between cognitive processing speed and GCS, as well as age-related changes of processing speed on cognitive performance. Therefore, this study recruited 34 younger and 39 older adults to verify age-related differences in relationships between cognitive processing speed and GCS. We measured cognitive processing speed with the Processing Speed Index of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Findings indicated that cognitive processing speed predicted GCS in older but not younger adults. Future research may be needed to verify the training effect of processing speed on GCS. This study also further examined cognitive factors related to processing speed in aging and the relationships between cognitive processing speed and verbal fluency, cognitive inhibition, and divided attention. A stepwise regression analysis indicated that only verbal fluency contributed significantly to cognitive processing speed in older adults, accounting for 21% of the variance. These observations suggest that age-related changes of prefrontal regions may not fully explain age-related decline in cognitive processing speed.\n",

Data came from the Manchester Longitudinal Study of Cognition, a 20-plus-year investigation of 6,203 individuals ages 42-97 years. Cognitive domains were general crystallized intelligence, general fluid intelligence, verbal memory, visuospatial memory, and processing speed. Life span decrements were evident across these domains, controlling for baseline performance at age 70 and adjusting for retest effects. Survival analyses stratified by sex and conducted independently by cognitive domain showed that lower baseline performance levels in all domains-and larger life span decrements in general fluid intelligence and processing speed-were predictive of increased mortality risk for both women and men. Critically, analyses of the combined predictive power of cognitive performance variables showed that baseline levels of processing speed (in women) and general fluid intelligence (in men), and decrements in processing speed (in women and in men) and general fluid intelligence (in women), accounted for most of the explained variation in mortality risk. In light of recent evidence from brain-imaging studies, we speculate that cognitive abilities closely linked to cerebral white matter integrity (such as processing speed and general fluid intelligence) may represent particularly sensitive markers of mortality risk. In addition, we presume that greater complexity in cognition-survival associations observed in women (in analyses incorporating all cognitive predictors) may be a consequence of longer and more variable cognitive declines in women relative to men.\n",

If untreated, WD, which is initially a liver disease, can turn into a multi-systemic disease with neurological involvement. Very few studies have described cognitive impairment in WD. The aim of this study is to report the cognitive profile of 31 treated WD patients. METHODS: Patients were classed into two groups using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS): WD patients without neurological signs (WD-N(-)) (n=13), and WD patients with neurological signs (WD-N(+)) (n=18). The patients participated in a neuropsychological assessment evaluating memory, executive function and visuo-spatial abilities. RESULTS: Both groups performed well for verbal intelligence and episodic memory skills. However, the majority of these patients exhibited altered performance for at least one cognitive test, particularly in the executive domain. The WD-N(+) group performed less well than the WD-N(-) group on cognitive tests involving rapid motor function, abstract thinking, working memory and top-down inhibitory control. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment in treated WD patients essentially affects executive function involving fronto-striatal circuits. Verbal intelligence and episodic memory abilities seem to be remarkably preserved. Neuropsychological assessment is a valuable tool to evaluate the presence and the consequences of these cognitive impairments in WD patients with or without neurological signs in the course of this chronic disease.\n",

            "The development of verbal fluency is associated with the maturation of executive function skills, such as the ability to inhibit irrelevant information, shift between tasks, and hold information in working memory. Some evidence suggests that multilinguistic upbringing may underpin disadvantages in verbal fluency and lexical retrieval, but can also afford executive function advantages beyond the language system including possible beneficial effects in older age. This study examined the relationship between verbal fluency and executive function in 324 individuals across the lifespan by assessing the developmental trajectories of English monolingual and multilingual children aged 7-15 years (N = 154) and adults from 18 to 80 years old (N = 170). The childhood data indicated patterns of improvement in verbal fluency and executive function skills as a function of age. Multilingual and monolingual children had comparable developmental trajectories in all linguistic and non-linguistic measures used in the study with the exception of planning, for which monolingual children showed a steeper improvement over the studied age range relative to multilingual children. For adults, monolinguals and multilingual participants had comparable performance on all measures with the exception of nonverbal inhibitory control and response times on the Tower of London task: monolinguals showed a steeper decline associated with age. Exploratory factor analysis indicated that verbal fluency was associated with working memory and fluid intelligence in monolingual participants but not in multilinguals. These findings raise the possibility that early acquisition of an additional language may impact on the development of the functional architecture serving high-level human cognition.\n",

This study investigated whether antenatal maternal perceived stress and variants of the rs12193738 and rs2179515 polymorphisms on the KIAA0319 gene interact to affect reading ability and full-scale IQ (FSIQ) in members of the longitudinal Auckland Birthweight Collaborative study. Antenatal maternal stress was measured at birth, and reading ability was assessed at ages 7 and 16. Reading data were available for 500 participants at age 7 and 479 participants at age 16. FSIQ was measured at ages 7 and 11. At age 11, DNA samples were collected. Analyses of covariance revealed that individuals with the TT genotype of the rs12193738 polymorphism exposed to high maternal stress during pregnancy possessed significantly poorer reading ability (as measured by Woodcock-Johnson Word Identification standard scores) during adolescence compared with TT carriers exposed to low maternal stress. TT carriers of the rs12193738 SNP also obtained lower IQ scores at age 7 than C allele carriers. These findings suggest that the KIAA0319 gene is associated with both reading ability and general cognition, but in different ways. The effect on IQ appears to occur earlier in development and is transient, whereas the effect of reading ability occurs later and is moderated by antenatal maternal stress.

Data from the longitudinal Auckland Birthweight Collaborative (ABC) study was used. Maternal perceived stress over the prior month was measured at birth, 3.5 and 7years. Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ) was measured at ages 7 and 11. At age 11, a total of 546 DNA samples were collected from the child participants. Data were subjected to a series of split-plot ANCOVAs with birthweight for gestational age and maternal school leaving age as covariates. There were direct effects of maternal stress during the last month of pregnancy on offspring FSIQ at ages 7 and 11years. A significant interaction revealed that children exposed to high maternal antenatal stress had significantly lower FSIQ scores at both 7 and 11years of age than those exposed to low stress, only when they were carriers of the rs165599 G allele.

DESIGN: We analyzed data from two US-based multisite prospective cohort studies. METHODS: Multivariable general linear regression models were used to evaluate associations of age at viral suppression and CPE scores (of initial antiretroviral therapy regimen and weighted average) with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third or Fourth Edition neurocognitive assessments [Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ); Performance IQ/Perceptual Reasoning Index (PIQ/PRI); and Verbal IQ/Verbal Comprehension Index (VIQ/VCI)], adjusted for demographic and clinical covariates. Sensitivity analyses were stratified by birth cohort (before versus after 1996). RESULTS: A total of 396 PHIV+ children were included. Estimated differences in mean FSIQ (comparing virally suppressed versus unsuppressed children) by each age cutoff were 3.7, 2.2, 3.2, 4.4, and 3.9 points at ages 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. For PIQ/PRI, estimated mean differences were 3.7, 2.4, 2.2, 4.6, and 4.5 at ages 1 through 5, respectively. In both cases, these differences were significant only at the age 4 and 5 thresholds. After stratifying by birth cohort, the association between age at suppression and cognitive function persisted only among those born after 1996. Age at viral suppression was not associated with VIQ/VCI; CPE score was not associated with FSIQ, verbal comprehension, or perceptual reasoning indices. CONCLUSION: Virologic suppression during infancy or early childhood is associated with improved neurocognitive outcomes in school-aged PHIV+ children.

            "This study examines the extent to which iron deficiency in infancy contributes to adverse neurocognitive and educational outcomes in young adulthood directly and indirectly, through its influence on verbal cognition and attention problems in childhood. Young adults (N = 1,000, M age = 21.3 years, 52% female; of Spanish or indigenous descent) from working-class families in Santiago, Chile, completed instruments assessing memory, processing speed, mental flexibility, and educational attainment. Iron status was assessed at ages 6, 12, and 18 months, and verbal intelligence, inattention, and sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms were assessed at age 10. Results indicated that young adults who had iron-deficiency in infancy had poor executive control at age 21. Severity of iron deficiency during infancy was associated with lower verbal IQ and more frequent inattention and SCT symptoms in childhood, and with lower educational attainment in young adulthood through its effect on inattention. No additional indirect effects were found. Interventions directed toward improving cognitive and attention deficits linked to early-life iron deficiency appear warranted and could alter the course to adult functioning. Further research on the impact of such interventions would be helpful. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).\n",

A cohort having TAPVC repair at age </=6 weeks between 1998 and 2007 were followed by the Complex Pediatric Therapies Follow-up Program at 4.5 years. Outcomes include mortality, full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ), verbal IQ (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ), visual motor integration (VMI), and general adaptive composite of the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (GAC). There were 51 infants with simple TAPVC [4 year mortality 4 (8%)], and 16 with complex TAPVC [4 year mortality 7 (44%)], hazard ratio (HR) 7.02 (95% CI 2.05-24.07, p = 0.002). Of the 47 survivors after simple TAPVC, FSIQ (SD) was 92 (17), VIQ 92 (17), PIQ 94 (15), VMI 92 (15), and GAC 92 (15). Independent predictors of neurocognitive outcome included father's socioeconomic status, mother's years of schooling, gender, post-operative base deficit, and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) time. Complex TAPVC was associated on univariate analysis only with PIQ [81.9 (10.2) vs. 93.6 (15.4); p = 0.012] and FSIQ [80.7 (10.1) vs. 92.0 (17.7); p = 0.017]. Original peoples accounted for 25/51 (49%) of simple and 3/16 (19%) of complex TAPVC. Original peoples race was associated with 4-year mortality [HR 6.85 (95% CI 2.15, 21.76, p = 0.001)]. Survivors of TAPVC repair in early infancy have encouraging neurocognitive outcomes. Few independent predictors of neurocognitive outcome were found, with post-operative acidosis and DHCA time being potentially modifiable.

            "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As technology advances, surgical training has evolved in parallel over the previous decade. Training is commonly seen as a way to prepare surgeons for their day-to-day work; however, more importantly, it allows for certification of skills to ensure maximum patient safety. This article reviews advances in the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence for improvements of surgical skills in urology. RECENT FINDINGS: Six studies have been published, which met the inclusion criteria. All articles assessed the application of artificial intelligence in improving surgical training. Different approaches were taken, such as using machine learning to identify and classify suturing gestures, creating automated objective evaluation reports, and determining surgical technical skill levels to predict clinical outcomes. The articles illustrated the continuously growing role of artificial intelligence to address the difficulties currently present in evaluating urological surgical skills. SUMMARY: Artificial intelligence allows us to efficiently analyze the surmounting data related to surgical training and use it to come to conclusions that normally would require human intelligence. Although these metrics have been shown to predict surgeon expertise and surgical outcomes, evidence is still scarce regarding their ability to directly improve patient outcomes. Considering this, current active research is growing on the topic of deep learning-based computer vision to provide automated metrics needed for real-time surgeon feedback.\n",

            "Artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrated by machines is based on reinforcement learning and revolves around the usage of algorithms. The purpose of this review was to summarize concepts, the scope, applications, and limitations in major gastrointestinal surgery. This is a narrative review of the available literature on the key capabilities of AI to help anesthesiologists, surgeons, and other physicians to understand and critically evaluate ongoing and new AI applications in perioperative management. AI uses available databases called \"big data\" to formulate an algorithm. Analysis of other data based on these algorithms can help in early diagnosis, accurate risk assessment, intraoperative management, automated drug delivery, predicting anesthesia and surgical complications and postoperative outcomes and can thus lead to effective perioperative management as well as to reduce the cost of treatment. Perioperative physicians, anesthesiologists, and surgeons are well-positioned to help integrate AI into modern surgical practice. We all need to partner and collaborate with data scientists to collect and analyze data across all phases of perioperative care to provide clinical scenarios and context. Careful implementation and use of AI along with real-time human interpretation will revolutionize perioperative care, and is the way forward in future perioperative management of major surgery.\n",

            "PURPOSE: The aim of the current narrative review was to summarize the available evidence in the literature on artificial intelligence (AI) methods that have been applied during robotic surgery. METHODS: A narrative review of the literature was performed on MEDLINE/Pubmed and Scopus database on the topics of artificial intelligence, autonomous surgery, machine learning, robotic surgery, and surgical navigation, focusing on articles published between January 2015 and June 2019. All available evidences were analyzed and summarized herein after an interactive peer-review process of the panel. LITERATURE REVIEW: The preliminary results of the implementation of AI in clinical setting are encouraging. By providing a readout of the full telemetry and a sophisticated viewing console, robot-assisted surgery can be used to study and refine the application of AI in surgical practice. Machine learning approaches strengthen the feedback regarding surgical skills acquisition, efficiency of the surgical process, surgical guidance and prediction of postoperative outcomes. Tension-sensors on the robotic arms and the integration of augmented reality methods can help enhance the surgical experience and monitor organ movements. CONCLUSIONS: The use of AI in robotic surgery is expected to have a significant impact on future surgical training as well as enhance the surgical experience during a procedure. Both aim to realize precision surgery and thus to increase the quality of the surgical care. Implementation of AI in master-slave robotic surgery may allow for the careful, step-by-step consideration of autonomous robotic surgery.\n",

These programs use mammography to screen the women who are invited to participate. Digital mammography makes it possible to develop computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems that promise to reduce the workload of radiologists participating in screening programs. However, various studies have shown that CAD results in a high rate of false positive diagnoses. Systems based on artificial intelligence are being more widely implemented, and studies have shown that these systems have better diagnostic performance than traditional CAD systems.

During adolescence, all these factors are prone to reduce peer connectedness and school life satisfaction. The aim of the present study was to disentangle the effects of these factors in a sample of 492 sixth and 10th graders. We identified three subsamples based on different characteristics associated with giftedness: students previously identified as gifted (n = 66), students who scored in the top 10% on a general intelligence test (n = 49), and students who had skipped a grade (n = 57). Comparative analysis showed that none of these subsamples differed from their respective control groups on school life satisfaction. Students labeled as gifted reported a lower level of peer connectedness, and the latter's contribution to school life satisfaction was significantly stronger within this subsample. These results underscore the importance of social integration for adolescents identified as intellectually gifted and exclude grade skipping as a risk factor. Moreover, high intellectual level does not seem to impact either school life satisfaction or peer connectedness.\n",

A sample of 1,743 high-ability college students reported on whether and when they had been identified as gifted, academic ability (SAT scores), and implicit beliefs of intelligence. Timing of identification was unrelated to implicit beliefs; academic ability was the only significant predictor. Higher ability students who had been previously identified as gifted at any point in time reported implicit beliefs more toward entity beliefs than relatively lower ability students who had also been identified; however, this effect was quite small. Implicit beliefs did not vary by ability level for nonidentified students. These findings suggest that identification as gifted at any age modestly (but not necessarily meaningfully) relates to implicit beliefs for high-ability students.\n",

Finally, we determined if working memory interfered with scores in different Rey stages or not. MATERIAL & METHODS: This study was conducted in Tehran City, Iran in 2013. Scores on RAVLT were compared with WISC- R digit span results in a sample of 148 male students aged 12-14 yr old divided into two groups including 75 students in typical school (IQ ranging between 90 and 110) and 73 gifted students (IQs ranging between 110 and 130). RESULTS: Gifted students obtained higher scores than typical students in both Forward Digit Span (FDS) and Backward Digit Span (BDS) and all 9 stages of RAVLT comparing with typical students (P<0.001). There was no significant difference between different ages (P> 0.05). The 14 yr old students in both groups had the highest score. There was a high correlation between FDS and the first stage of RAVLT as well as high correlation between BDS and seventh stage of RAVLT. CONCLUSION: Intelligence has effect on better score of memory and gifted subjects had better scores in memory tests, although the intelligence effect in learning was quantitative rather than qualitative. RAVLT is a comprehensive test, which evaluates short-term memory, working memory and long-term memory and besides Digit span test provides precious information about memory and learning of subjects in order to program different student's educational schedules.\n",

            "The Ability Achievement Discrepancy model remains the primary identification method used by school personnel. This study examined identification of a specific learning disability using the Ability Achievement Discrepancy model with the Woodcock-Johnson IV (WJ-IV). Two different test scores can be used to represent the ability construct: one that maintains the overlap between intelligence quotient (IQ) and basic psychological processes (i.e., general intellectual ability) and one that mostly removes the overlap between IQ and basic psychological processes (i.e., fluid-crystallized intelligence). The study included 3,736 individuals from the WJ-IV standardization sample to ascertain whether different proportions of individuals were identified by the 2 methods as well as identify which tests contributed to the differences. chi2 tests of independence and absolute ratios were used to examine the proportion of individuals identified; a multivariate analysis of variance and follow-up Tukey honestly significant differences were conducted to determine whether the groups of individuals identified in each model differed on their academic achievement scores, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to identify the tests that contributed to differences in identification rates. The results indicated that different proportions of individuals were identified as a function of the IQ score used, even though achievement scores were generally similar across identification methods. Black students were overrepresented and White students were underrepresented compared with their proportion in the total sample. Discrepancy profiles largely varied as a function of the internal psychometrics of the WJ-IV rather than characteristics of the individual.

            "The lack of transparency is one of the artificial intelligence (AI)'s fundamental challenges, but the concept of transparency might be even more opaque than AI itself. Researchers in different fields who attempt to provide the solutions to improve AI's transparency articulate different but neighboring concepts that include, besides transparency, explainability and interpretability. Yet, there is no common taxonomy neither within one field (such as data science) nor between different fields (law and data science). In certain areas like healthcare, the requirements of transparency are crucial since the decisions directly affect people's lives. In this paper, we suggest an interdisciplinary vision on how to tackle the issue of AI's transparency in healthcare, and we propose a single point of reference for both legal scholars and data scientists on transparency and related concepts. Based on the analysis of the European Union (EU) legislation and literature in computer science, we submit that transparency shall be considered the \"way of thinking\" and umbrella concept characterizing the process of AI's development and use. Transparency shall be achieved through a set of measures such as interpretability and explainability, communication, auditability, traceability, information provision, record-keeping, data governance and management, and documentation. This approach to deal with transparency is of general nature, but transparency measures shall be always contextualized. By analyzing transparency in the healthcare context, we submit that it shall be viewed as a system of accountabilities of involved subjects (AI developers, healthcare professionals, and patients) distributed at different layers (insider, internal, and external layers, respectively). The transparency-related accountabilities shall be built-in into the existing accountability picture which justifies the need to investigate the relevant legal frameworks. These frameworks correspond to different layers of the transparency system. The requirement of informed medical consent correlates to the external layer of transparency and the Medical Devices Framework is relevant to the insider and internal layers. We investigate the said frameworks to inform AI developers on what is already expected from them with regards to transparency. We also discover the gaps in the existing legislative frameworks concerning AI's transparency in healthcare and suggest the solutions to fill them in.\n",

            "This paper is one of the first to analyse the ethical implications of specific healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) applications, and the first to provide a detailed analysis of AI-based systems for clinical decision support. AI is increasingly being deployed across multiple domains. In response, a plethora of ethical guidelines and principles for general AI use have been published, with some convergence about which ethical concepts are relevant to this new technology. However, few of these frameworks are healthcare-specific, and there has been limited examination of actual AI applications in healthcare. Our ethical evaluation identifies context- and case-specific healthcare ethical issues for two applications, and investigates the extent to which the general ethical principles for AI-assisted healthcare expressed in existing frameworks capture what is most ethically relevant from the perspective of healthcare ethics. We provide a detailed description and analysis of two AI-based systems for clinical decision support (Painchek((R)) and IDx-DR). Our results identify ethical challenges associated with potentially deceptive promissory claims, lack of patient and public involvement in healthcare AI development and deployment, and lack of attention to the impact of AIs on healthcare relationships. Our analysis also highlights the close connection between evaluation and technical development and reporting. Critical appraisal frameworks for healthcare AIs should include explicit ethical evaluation with benchmarks.

            "Most living beings are able to perform actions that can be considered intelligent or, at the very least, the result of an appropriate reaction to changing circumstances in their environment. However, the intelligence or intellectual processes of humans are vastly superior to those achieved by all other species. The adult human brain is a highly complex organ weighing approximately 1500g, which accounts for only 2% of the total body weight but consumes an amount of energy equal to that required by all skeletal muscle at rest. Although the human brain displays a typical primate structure, it can be identified by its specific distinguishing features. The process of evolution and humanisation of the Homo sapiens brain resulted in a unique and distinct organ with the largest relative volume of any animal species. It also permitted structural reorganization of tissues and circuits in specific segments and regions. These steps explain the remarkable cognitive abilities of modern humans compared not only with other species in our genus, but also with older members of our own species. Brain evolution required the coexistence of two adaptation mechanisms. The first involves genetic changes that occur at the species level, and the second occurs at the individual level and involves changes in chromatin organisation or epigenetic changes. The genetic mechanisms include: a) genetic changes in coding regions that lead to changes in the sequence and activity of existing proteins; b) duplication and deletion of previously existing genes; c) changes in gene expression through changes in the regulatory sequences of different genes; and d) synthesis of non-coding RNAs. Lastly, this review describes some of the main documented chromosomal differences between humans and great apes. These differences have also contributed to the evolution and humanisation process of the H. sapiens brain.\n",

The aim is to identify varied sets of creativity and personal adaptation resource markers that differentiate groups of children in order to determine possible strategies for adaptation, preservation, and development of their creative abilities at the beginning of lyceum schooling. It embraces the use of the E. Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT) (figural version), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), and the G. Rorschach Test. A sample of the study consisted of 122 children, aged 6-7 and enrolled in a school. The average IQ score among the children was above 115 (M = 133.7, sigma = 9.9). The entire sample was divided into four groups by the originality-elaboration ratio according to the TTCT. The correctness of the children's division into the groups according to the markers of creativity and personal adaptation resources is confirmed by the discriminant analysis. We have identified the factor structure of creativity, intelligence, and personal adaptation resources in the entire sample of children and in each of the groups. In the group of preschoolers with high originality and elaboration, the resulting structure integrated the components of creativity with personal adaptation resources and intelligence scores. In the group of children with a low level of originality and elaboration, the markers of creativity, intelligence, and personal adaptation resources are not interlinked.\n",

Grid cells are neurons in the entorhinal cortex that represent the location of an animal in its environment. Recent evidence suggests that grid cell-like neurons may also be present in the neocortex. We propose that grid cells exist throughout the neocortex, in every region and in every cortical column. They define a location-based framework for how the neocortex functions. Whereas grid cells in the entorhinal cortex represent the location of one thing, the body relative to its environment, we propose that cortical grid cells simultaneously represent the location of many things. Cortical columns in somatosensory cortex track the location of tactile features relative to the object being touched and cortical columns in visual cortex track the location of visual features relative to the object being viewed. We propose that mechanisms in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus that evolved for learning the structure of environments are now used by the neocortex to learn the structure of objects. Having a representation of location in each cortical column suggests mechanisms for how the neocortex represents object compositionality and object behaviors. It leads to the hypothesis that every part of the neocortex learns complete models of objects and that there are many models of each object distributed throughout the neocortex. The similarity of circuitry observed in all cortical regions is strong evidence that even high-level cognitive tasks are learned and represented in a location-based framework.\n",

Human problem solving is typically studied as a search in a problem space composed of states (information about the environment) and operators (to move between states). A problem such as playing a game of chess has 10120 possible states, and a traveling salesperson problem with as little as 82 cities already has more than 10120 different tours (similar to chess). Biological neurons are slower than the digital switches in computers. An exhaustive search of the problem space exceeds the capacity of current computers for most interesting problems, and it is fairly clear that humans cannot in their lifetime exhaustively search even small fractions of these problem spaces. Yet, humans play chess and solve logistical problems of similar complexity on a daily basis. Even for simple problems humans do not typically engage in exploring even a small fraction of the problem space. This begs the question: How do humans solve problems on a daily basis in a fast and efficient way? Recent work suggests that humans build a problem representation and solve the represented problem-not the problem that is out there. The problem representation that is built and the process used to solve it are constrained by limits of cognitive capacity and a cost-benefit analysis discounting effort and reward. In this article, we argue that better understanding the way humans represent and solve problems using heuristics can help inform how simpler algorithms and representations can be used in artificial intelligence to lower computational complexity, reduce computation time, and facilitate real-time computation in complex problem solving.\n",

Although there is a technique that captures people's streams of free thought-free association-its utility for scientific research is undermined by two open questions: (a) How can streams of thought be quantified? (b) Do such streams predict psychological phenomena? We resolve the first issue-quantification-by presenting a new metric, \"forward flow,\" that uses latent semantic analysis to capture the semantic evolution of thoughts over time (i.e., how much present thoughts diverge from past thoughts). We resolve the second issue-prediction-by examining whether forward flow predicts creativity in the lab and the real world. Our studies reveal that forward flow predicts creativity in college students (Study 1) and a representative sample of Americans (Study 2), even when controlling for intelligence. Studies also reveal that membership in real-world creative groups-performance majors (Study 3), professional actors (Study 4) and entrepreneurs (Study 5)-is predicted by forward flow, even when controlling for performance on divergent thinking tasks. Study 6 reveals that forward flow in celebrities' social media posts (i.e., on Twitter) predicts their creative achievement. In addition to creativity, forward flow may also help predict mental illness, emotional experience, leadership ability, adaptability, neural dynamics, group productivity, and cultural success. We present open-access online tools for assessing and visualizing forward flow for both illustrative and large-scale data analytic purposes.

            "The variability of chemical bonding in open-shell transition-metal complexes not only motivates their study as functional materials and catalysts but also challenges conventional computational modeling tools. Here, tailoring ligand chemistry can alter preferred spin or oxidation states as well as electronic structure properties and reactivity, creating vast regions of chemical space to explore when designing new materials atom by atom. Although first-principles density functional theory (DFT) remains the workhorse of computational chemistry in mechanism deduction and property prediction, it is of limited use here. DFT is both far too computationally costly for widespread exploration of transition-metal chemical space and also prone to inaccuracies that limit its predictive performance for localized d electrons in transition-metal complexes. These challenges starkly contrast with the well-trodden regions of small-organic-molecule chemical space, where the analytical forms of molecular mechanics force fields and semiempirical theories have for decades accelerated the discovery of new molecules, accurate DFT functional performance has been demonstrated, and gold-standard methods from correlated wavefunction theory can predict experimental results to chemical accuracy.The combined promise of transition-metal chemical space exploration and lack of established tools has mandated a distinct approach. In this Account, we outline the path we charted in exploration of transition-metal chemical space starting from the first machine learning (ML) models (i.e., artificial neural network and kernel ridge regression) and representations for the prediction of open-shell transition-metal complex properties. The distinct importance of the immediate coordination environment of the metal center as well as the lack of low-level methods to accurately predict structural properties in this coordination environment first motivated and then benefited from these ML models and representations. Once developed, the recipe for prediction of geometric, spin state, and redox potential properties was straightforwardly extended to a diverse range of other properties, including in catalysis, computational \"feasibility\", and the gas separation properties of periodic metal-organic frameworks. Interpretation of selected features most important for model prediction revealed new ways to encapsulate design rules and confirmed that models were robustly mapping essential structure-property relationships. Encountering the special challenge of ensuring that good model performance could generalize to new discovery targets motivated investigation of how to best carry out model uncertainty quantification. Distance-based approaches, whether in model latent space or in carefully engineered feature space, provided intuitive measures of the domain of applicability. With all of these pieces together, ML can be harnessed as an engine to tackle the large-scale exploration of transition-metal chemical space needed to satisfy multiple objectives using efficient global optimization methods. In practical terms, bringing these artificial intelligence tools to bear on the problems of transition-metal chemical space exploration has resulted in ML-model assessments of large, multimillion compound spaces in minutes and validated new design leads in weeks instead of decades.\n",

How does the brain augment state creativity when creative thinking is required? Can augmented creative state be consciously engaged and disengaged dynamically across time? Using a novel \"thin slice\" creativity paradigm in 55 fMRI participants performing verb-generation, we successfully cued large, conscious, short-duration increases in state creativity, indexed quantitatively by a measure of semantic distance derived via latent semantic analysis. A region of left frontopolar cortex, previously associated with creative integration of semantic information, exhibited increased activity and functional connectivity to anterior cingulate gyrus and right frontopolar cortex during cued augmentation of state creativity.

This paper proposes a study on mental health intelligence assessment based on multisource information fusion. Combining the data description of UPI and SCL-90 and the corresponding task requirement analysis, the multisource information fusion visualization based on the Circos diagram is designed and realized, and the parallel coordinate visualization is established. The MDS algorithm is used to project multidimensional survey objects into low-dimensional visualization space, and the actual UPI and SCL-90 questionnaire data for 278 students of a certain major at a university provided by the cooperative unit are used. The results show that the mental health problems of student A are serious, and the symptoms of depression and schizophrenia are prominent, so it is necessary to seek psychological experts for corresponding treatment in time. By contrast, student B's mental health problems are also serious, and the user judges that student B still needs further diagnosis and treatment. The correlation analysis results of multisource information fusion are roughly the same as the actual situation, which is convincing. Therefore, the multisource mental health information fusion of college students has a certain correlation and complementarity.\n",

Artificial intelligence and big data, as emerging technologies that have attracted much attention in recent years, have broad application and development space in improving the development of intelligent and refined education in colleges and universities. Applying artificial intelligence and big data to the practice of college students' mental health education plays a very positive role in accurately finding and scientifically solving college students' mental health problems. This paper combs the current application and research of artificial intelligence and big data in college students' mental health education and then clarifies the problems existing in the practical application. Finally, on the basis of in-depth analysis of the characteristics of college students' psychological crisis, the paper designs college students' psychological crisis early warning data collection system from six aspects, including the educational administration system and the access control system.

            "PURPOSE: Mental health assessments that combine patients' facial expressions and behaviors have been proven effective, but screening large-scale student populations for mental health problems is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This study aims to provide an efficient and accurate intelligent method for further psychological diagnosis and treatment, which combines artificial intelligence technologies to assist in evaluating the mental health problems of college students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We propose a mixed-method study of mental health assessment that combines psychological questionnaires with facial emotion analysis to comprehensively evaluate the mental health of students on a large scale. The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21(DASS-21) is used for the psychological questionnaire. The facial emotion recognition model is implemented by transfer learning based on neural networks, and the model is pre-trained using FER2013 and CFEE datasets. Among them, the FER2013 dataset consists of 48 x 48-pixel face gray images, a total of 35,887 face images. The CFEE dataset contains 950,000 facial images with annotated action units (au). Using a random sampling strategy, we sent online questionnaires to 400 college students and received 374 responses, and the response rate was 93.5%. After pre-processing, 350 results were available, including 187 male and 153 female students. First, the facial emotion data of students were collected in an online questionnaire test. Then, a pre-trained model was used for emotion recognition. Finally, the online psychological questionnaire scores and the facial emotion recognition model scores were collated to give a comprehensive psychological evaluation score. RESULTS: The experimental results of the facial emotion recognition model proposed to show that its classification results are broadly consistent with the mental health survey results. This model can be used to improve efficiency. In particular, the accuracy of the facial emotion recognition model proposed in this paper is higher than that of the general mental health model, which only uses the traditional single questionnaire. Furthermore, the absolute errors of this study in the three symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress are lower than other mental health survey results and are only 0.8%, 8.1%, 3.5%, and 1.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The mixed method combining intelligent methods and scales for mental health assessment has high recognition accuracy. Therefore, it can support efficient large-scale screening of students' psychological problems.\n",

Big data and artificial intelligence (AI) are combined to evaluate the mental health education of college students in sports majors. First, the research status on the mental health education of college students is introduced. The internet of things (IoT) on mental health education, a structure based on big data and convolutional neural network (CNN), is constructed. Next, the survey design and questionnaire survey are carried out. Finally, the questionnaire data are analyzed and compared with the mental health status under traditional education. The results show that the CNN model has good accuracy and ability to distinguish symptoms, so it can be applied to the existing psychological work in colleges. In the symptom comparison survey, under the traditional education and big data network, the number of college students with mild mental health problems is found to be 158 (84.9%) and 170 (91.4%), respectively. It indicates that the number of college students with moderate mental health problems decreases significantly. In the comparative investigation of the severity of mental problems, the number of students with normal mental health, subhealth, and serious mental health problems under the background of traditional mental health education is 125 (67.2%), 56 (30.1%), and 5 (2.7%), respectively. The mental health status of college students under the influence of big data networks on mental health education is better than that of traditional mental health education. There are 140 students with normal mental health, a year-on-year increase of 16.7%. In the comparative survey of specific mental disorders, students with obsessive-compulsive symptoms under traditional mental health education account for 22.0% of the total sample, having the largest proportion. In the subhealth psychological group under the big data network on mental health education, the number of hostile students decreases by 7, which is the psychological factor with the most obvious improvement.

BACKGROUND: Nurse intent to stay and transformational leadership are widely recognized as vital components of nurse retention. Staff nurse emotional intelligence that has been confirmed improvable has been recently recognized in the nursing literature as correlated with retention. Yet, the nature of the relationships among these three variables is not known. METHODS: Cross-sectional data for 535 Chinese nurses were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling. RESULTS: Transformational leadership and staff nurse emotional intelligence were significant predictors of nurse intent to stay, accounting for 34.3% of the variance in nurse intent to stay. Staff nurse emotional intelligence partially mediates the relationship between transformational leadership and nurse intent to stay. CONCLUSION: The findings of the study emphasized the importance of transformational leadership in enhancing nurse emotional intelligence and to provide a deeper understanding of the mediating role of emotional intelligence in the relationship between nurse manager's transformational leadership and nurse's intent to stay.

This review defines leadership as \"a combination of position, responsibilities, attitude, skills, and behaviors that allows someone to bring out the best in others, and the best in their organization, in a sustainable manner.\" There are many traits and skills demonstrated by leaders.

We designed a click-and-drag version of the Raven test in which participants could create different external spatial configurations while solving the puzzles. In our first study, we observed that the click-and-drag test was better than the conventional static test at predicting academic achievement of university students. This pattern of results was partially replicated in a novel sample. Importantly, environment-altering actions were clustered in between periods of apparent inactivity, suggesting that problem-solvers were delicately balancing the execution of internal and external cognitive operations. We observed a systematic relationship between this critical phasic temporal signature and improved test performance. Our approach is widely applicable and offers an opportunity to quantitatively assess a powerful, although understudied, feature of human intelligence: our ability to use external objects, props and aids to solve complex problems.\n",

Additionally, gender differences were taken into account in these relationships. Participants filled in the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT), the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices, the reduced version of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, and academic achievement measures. Results showed that El abilities were positively related to academic achievement indices, such as the number of exams and grade point average; total El ability and the Perceiving branch were negatively associated with the study time spent preparing for exams. Furthermore, El ability adds a percentage of incremental variance with respect to cognitive ability and personality variables in explaining scholastic success. The magnitude of the associations between El abilities and academic achievement measures was generally higher for men than for women. Jointly considered, the present findings support the incremental validity of the MSCEIT and provide positive indications of the importance of El in students' academic development.

The discrepancy between the predicted and observed Raven APM scores was transformed into a percentile distribution as an indicator of intellectual decline, which can be used in clinical practice. The validity of the procedure was further examined by comparing the proportion of persons with a significant decline (at the -1 and -1.65 SD level) between two older patient samples (87 patients with cerebral stroke and 387 patients with diabetes mellitus) by means of chi(2) tests. There was a significantly higher rate of intellectual decline at the -1 SD (\"below average\") and -1.65 SD (\"impaired\") cutoff levels for patients with stroke compared with patients with diabetes (stroke, 34% and 14%; diabetes, 16% and 5%, p < .05).

To articulate, bring attention to, and offer recommendations for diagnostic uncertainty, the Barbara Volcker Center at the Hospital for Special Surgery sponsored, in April 2021, a virtual international workshop, \"When a Diagnosis Has No Name.\" This paper summarizes the opinions of 72 stakeholders from the fields of medical research, industry, federal regulatory agencies, insurers, hospital management, medical philosophy, public media, health care law, clinical rheumatology, other specialty areas of medicine, and patients. Speakers addressed the effects of diagnostic uncertainty in their fields. The workshop addressed the following six questions: What is a diagnosis? What are the purposes of diagnoses? How do doctors assign diagnoses? What is uncertainty? What are its causes? How does understanding uncertainty offer opportunities to improve all fields of medicine? The workshop's conveners systematically reviewed video recordings of formal presentations, video recordings of open discussion periods, manuscripts, and slide files submitted by the speakers to develop consensus take-home messages, which were as follows: Diagnostic uncertainty causes harm when patients lack access to laboratory test and treatments, do not participate in research studies, are not counted in administrative and public health documents, and suffer humiliation in their interactions with others. Uncertainty offers opportunities, such as quantifying uncertainty, using statistical technologies and automated intelligence to stratify patient groups by level of uncertainty, using a common vocabulary, and considering the effects of time.\n",

In addition, English plays an essential role in the process of economic globalization, specifically in the majority of countries where English is not the native language. At the same time, as China's integration into the world grows, the importance of English has become more pronounced, and the demand for English language skills has increased. At present, China's ever-expanding opening to the outside world, its developing science and technology, and its rising international status have created an urgent need for English-speaking professionals. This will lay the foundation for China's economic and social development and enable China to play a greater and more active role in international affairs, which has great practical and far-reaching historical significance. At present, the traditional English teaching mode has been criticized due to a great number of issues. At the same time, the new English language standards and the change of evaluation methods have created new demands on English teaching methods. As a result, with the development of artificial intelligence technology, the application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of education has brought new directions for the optimization of English classroom. In addition, diversified network technologies also provide new support for the realization of intelligent and collaborative English classroom teaching. To be specific, the maturity of English intelligent speech synthesis and intelligent speech evaluation technologies has enabled intelligent technologies to reach or even surpass the level of human teachers in certain areas. However, due to the limitations of the market environment and evaluation methods, the products that can focus on English classroom teaching are not highly intelligent and less collaborative. What is more, the process of English classroom intelligence has stagnated compared to other subjects. Obviously, from the perspective of integrating artificial intelligence technology with English classroom, it is quite necessary and feasible to design and develop an intelligent teaching assistant that can be applied to college English teaching. As information technology continues to evolve, both national and teacher levels are beginning to focus on how it can be better used in the teaching of subjects.

The intelligent education system can not only solve the limitations of location, time, and resources in the traditional learning field but it can also provide learners with a convenient, real-time, and interactive learning environment and has become one of the important applications in the Internet field. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a swarm intelligence-enabled stochastic optimization scheme. It is derived from a model of bird population foraging behavior. Because of its benefits of ease of implementation, high accuracy, and quick convergence, this algorithm has gained the attention of academics, and it has demonstrated its supremacy in addressing real issues. This paper aims to study the optimization of PSO in the field of computational intelligence, improve the matching degree of learning resource recommendation and learning path optimization, and improve the learning efficiency of online learners. This paper suggests intelligent education as the center, takes the PSO algorithm as the main research object, and expounds the related concepts of intelligent education and PSO algorithm. It uses swarm intelligence algorithms for intelligent education personalized services. He focuses on PSO algorithm and its work in intelligent education recommendation and learning path planning. Experiments show that the average value of the difference between the two obtained by the NBPSO algorithm is 1.13E + 02 and the variance 1.88E + 02 is the smallest. Therefore, PSO aids in improving the quality and consistency of online course resource development. In conclusion, the research results of this paper further demonstrate the advantages of PSO algorithm in solving the problem of personalized service in intelligent education. It can promote the in-depth application of swarm intelligence optimization algorithms in intelligent online learning systems. This effectively enhances the intelligent service level of the online learning system and increases the efficiency of online learning.\n",

The aim of this paper is to investigate the ordering planning of a supply chain with multi supplier, multi distribution center, multi customer and one perishable raw material. This paper provides a mathematical model taking in consideration the limitation of raw material corruptibility (perishable material) which belongs to the category of NP-hard problems. To solve the proposed model, the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) are employed. In order to improve performances of ACO and PSO parameters, a Taguchi experimental design method was applied to set their proper values. Besides, to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, an example of the dairy industry is analyzed by using MATLAB R 2015a.

The sample comprised 200 non-clinical children, aged 9-13 years, and their parents (mothers and fathers). Results revealed that the effect of parental AS on children's AS is moderated by the children's EI for maternal AS and by their femininity traits for paternal AS. Learning experiences following somatic sensations influenced the children's level of AS. More specifically, special attention by parents following a child's somatic sensations (reinforcement and transmission of information) was associated with high AS in children. Parental reactions of fear following a parent's somatic sensations (modelling) seem to predict higher scores for AS when the link is moderated by the child's femininity orientation. The implications of these findings are discussed. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject The influence of parental factors in child's AS has been demonstrate, but these studies are limited. Specific mechanisms might condition the relationship between child's AS and parental factors. What does this study add? Learning experiences and parental AS influence the child's level of AS. It is important to consider the influence of mothers and fathers in child's AS. Child's emotional intelligence and expressive traits may moderate the effect of parental factors.\n",

This review defines leadership as \"a combination of position, responsibilities, attitude, skills, and behaviors that allows someone to bring out the best in others, and the best in their organization, in a sustainable manner.\" There are many traits and skills demonstrated by leaders. These include talent, drive, willpower, practical wisdom, loyalty, ethical behavior, emotional intelligence, integrity, self-awareness, and resilience. However, to best understand leadership we focus on what leaders are actually required to do, rather than on the skills and traits used to accomplish these tasks. We review nine functions that are at the core of leadership: serve as the public face of the organization; articulate the vision and mission; create culture; strategic planning; decide what to focus on; select, and develop, the right people; establish a decision-making process; manage your boss; and be responsible 24/7. All leaders operate in a specific context, during a unique point in the history of their organization, with a unique set of circumstances. What is required of the leader in one set of circumstances will change as those circumstances change.

Despite such promising objectives, very little is known about whether the implicit beliefs users may have about the changeability of their own behavior influence the way they experience self-tracking. These implicit beliefs about the permanence of the abilities are called mindsets; someone with a fixed mindset typically perceives human qualities (e.g., intelligence) as fixed, while someone with a growth mindset perceives them as amenable to change and improvement through learning. This paper investigates the concept of mindset in the context of self-tracking and uses online survey data from individuals wearing a self-tracking device (n = 290) to explore the ways in which users with different mindsets experience self-tracking. A combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches indicates that implicit beliefs about the changeability of behavior influence the extent to which users are self-determined toward self-tracking use. Moreover, differences were found in how users perceive and respond to failure, and how self-judgmental vs. self-compassionate they are toward their own mistakes. Overall, considering that how users respond to the self-tracking data is one of the core dimensions of self-tracking, our results suggest that mindset is one of the important determinants in shaping the self-tracking experience.

Here I revive David Hume's theory of motivation and action to argue that the most common understanding of the two conventionally recognized components of intelligence-reason and emotion-is confused. We say things like, 'Reason can overcome emotion', but to make this statement meaningful, we are forced to treat reason as a compound notion, as a forced and unhappy mixture of concepts that are incommensurate. An alternative is to parse intelligence in a different way, into two sets of capacities: (i) non-affective capacities, including logic, calculation and problem-solving; (ii) affective capacities, including wants, preferences and cares, along with the emotions. Thus, the question of convergence becomes two questions, one having to do with affective and one with non-affective capacities. What is the likelihood of convergence of these in non-human lineages, in other ecologies, on other worlds? Given certain assumptions, convergence of the non-affective capacities in thinking species seems likely, I argue, while convergence of the affective capacities seems much less likely.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Conversational agents have the ability to reach people through multiple mediums, including the online space, mobile phones, and hardware devices like Alexa and Google Home. Conversational agents provide an engaging method of interaction while making information easier to access. Their emergence into areas related to public health and health education is perhaps unsurprising. While the building of conversational agents is getting more simplified with time, there are still requirements of time and effort. There is also a lack of clarity and consistent terminology regarding what constitutes a conversational agent, how these agents are developed, and the kinds of resources that are needed to develop and sustain them. This lack of clarity creates a daunting task for those seeking to build conversational agents for health education initiatives. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to identify literature that reports on the design and implementation of conversational agents to promote and educate the public on matters related to health. We will categorize conversational agents in health education in alignment with current classifications and terminology emerging from the marketplace. We will clearly define the variety levels of conversational agents, categorize currently existing agents within these levels, and describe the development models, tools, and resources being used to build conversational agents for health care education purposes. METHODS: This scoping review will be conducted by employing the Arksey and O'Malley framework. We will also be adhering to the enhancements and updates proposed by Levac et al and Peters et al. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews will guide the reporting of this scoping review. A systematic search for published and grey literature will be undertaken from the following databases: (1) PubMed, (2) PsychINFO, (3) Embase, (4) Web of Science, (5) SCOPUS, (6) CINAHL, (7) ERIC, (8) MEDLINE, and (9) Google Scholar. Data charting will be done using a structured format. RESULTS: Initial searches of the databases retrieved 1305 results. The results will be presented in the final scoping review in a narrative and illustrative manner. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review will report on conversational agents being used in health education today, and will include categorization of the levels of the agents and report on the kinds of tools, resources, and design and development methods used.

Multiple studies have reported the development of these agents, and recent systematic reviews have described the scope of use of conversational agents in health care. However, there is scarce research on the effectiveness of these systems; thus, their viability and applicability are unclear. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of conversational agents in health care and to identify limitations, adverse events, and areas for future investigation of these agents. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols will be used to structure this protocol. The focus of the systematic review is guided by a population, intervention, comparator, and outcome framework. A systematic search of the PubMed (Medline), EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases will be conducted. Two authors will independently screen the titles and abstracts of the identified references and select studies according to the eligibility criteria. Any discrepancies will then be discussed and resolved. Two reviewers will independently extract and validate data from the included studies into a standardized form and conduct quality appraisal. RESULTS: As of January 2020, we have begun a preliminary literature search and piloting of the study selection process. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review aims to clarify the effectiveness, limitations, and future applications of conversational agents in health care. Our findings may be useful to inform the future development of conversational agents and promote the personalization of patient care.

Children (12 years of age and younger) often interact with AI through conversational agents (e.g., Siri and Alexa) that they speak with to receive information about the world. Conversational agents can mimic human social interactions, and it is important to develop socially intelligent agents appropriate for younger populations. Yet it is often unclear what data are curated to power many of these systems. This article applies a sociocultural developmental approach to examine child-centric intelligent conversational agents, including an overview of how children's development influences their social learning in the world and how that relates to AI.

Therefore, we reviewed the technologies used, targeted mental disorders and validation procedures of relevant proposals in this field. METHODS: We searched Scopus, PubMed, Pro-Quest, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library using a predefined search strategy. Studies were included if they focused on neuropsychiatric disorders and involved conversational data for detection and diagnosis. They were assessed for eligibility by independent reviewers and ultimately included if a consensus was reached about their relevance. RESULTS: 2356 references were initially retrieved. Eventually, 17 articles - referring 9 smart conversational agents - met the inclusion criteria. Out of the selected studies, 7 are targeted at neurocognitive disorders, 7 at depression and 3 at other conditions. They apply diverse technological solutions and analysis techniques (82.4% use Artificial Intelligence), and they usually rely on gold standard tests for criterion validity assessment. Acceptability, reliability and other aspects of validity were rarely addressed. CONCLUSION: The use of smart conversational agents for the detection of neuropsychiatric disorders is an emerging and promising field of research, with a broad coverage of mental disorders and extended use of AI. However, the few published studies did not undergo robust psychometric validation processes.

However, the existing accurate speech recognition products are based on massive data platform, which has the problems of slow response and security risk, which makes it difficult for the existing speech recognition products to meet the application requirements for timely translation of speech with high response time and network security requirements under the condition of network instability and insecurity. Based on this, this paper studies the analysis model of oral English evaluation algorithm based on Internet of things intelligent algorithm in speech recognition technology. Firstly, based on the automatic machine learning and lightweight learning strategy, a lightweight technology of automatic speech recognition depth neural network adapted to the edge computing power is proposed. Secondly, the quantitative evaluation of Internet of things intelligent classification algorithm and big data analysis in this system is described. In the evaluation, the evaluation method of oral English characteristics is adopted. At the same time, the Internet of things intelligent classification algorithm and big data analysis strategy are used to evaluate the accuracy of oral English. Finally, the experimental results show that the oral English feature recognition system based on Internet of things intelligent classification algorithm and big data analysis has the advantages of good reliability, high intelligence, and strong ability to resist subjective factors, which proves the advantages of Internet of things intelligent classification algorithm and big data analysis in English feature recognition.\n",

            "In order to solve the problem of tense consistency in Chinese-English neural machine translation (NMT) system, a Chinese verb tense annotation model is proposed. Firstly, a neural network is used to build a Chinese tense annotation model. During the translation process, the source tense is passed to the target side through the alignment matrix of the traditional Attention mechanism. The probability of the candidate words inconsistent with the corresponding tense of source words in the candidate translation word set is also reduced. Then, the Chinese-English temporal annotation algorithm is integrated into the MT model, so as to build a Chinese-English translation system with temporal processing function. The essence of the system is that, in the process of translation, Chinese-English temporal annotation algorithm is used to obtain temporal information from Chinese sentences and transfer it to the corresponding English sentences, so as to realize the temporal processing of English sentences and obtain the English sentences corresponding to the tenses of the original Chinese sentences. The experimental results show that the Chinese tense annotation model of bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) is more accurate for the prediction of Chinese verb tense, so the improvement effect of NMT model is also the most obvious, especially on the NIST06 test set, where the BLEU value is increased by 1.07%. As the mainstream translation model, the transformer model contains multihead Attention mechanism, which can pay attention to some temporal information and has a certain processing ability for temporal translation. It solves the tense problems encountered in the process of MT and improves the credibility of Chinese-English machine translation (MT).\n",

This work firstly conducts a theoretical analysis of natural language processing technology, analyzes the related technologies of intelligent scoring, designs a systematic process for intelligent scoring of college English teaching, and finally conducts theoretical research on the Naive Bayesian algorithm in machine learning. In addition, the error of intelligent scoring of English teaching in colleges and universities and the accuracy of scoring and classification are analyzed and researched. The results show that the error between manual scoring and machine scoring is basically about 2 points and the minimum error of intelligent scoring in college English teaching under machine scoring can reach 0 points. There is a certain bias in manual scoring, and scoring on the machine can reduce the generation of this error. The Naive Bayes algorithm has the highest classification accuracy on the college intelligent scoring dataset, which is 76.43%. The weighted Naive Bayes algorithm has been improved in the classification accuracy of college English teaching intelligent scoring, with an average accuracy rate of 74.87%. To sum up, the weighted Naive Bayes algorithm has better performance in the classification accuracy of college English intelligent scoring.

            "To commemorate 40 years since the founding of the Journal of Business Ethics, the editors in chief of the journal have invited the editors to provide commentaries on the future of business ethics. This essay comprises a selection of commentaries aimed at creating dialogue around the theme Ethics at the centre of global and local challenges. For much of the history of the Journal of Business Ethics, ethics was seen within the academy as a peripheral aspect of business. However, in recent years, the stakes have risen dramatically, with global and local worlds destabilized by financial crisis, climate change, internet technologies and artificial intelligence, and global health crises. The authors of these commentaries address these grand challenges by placing business ethics at their centre. What if all grand challenges were framed as grand ethical challenges? Tanusree Jain, Arno Kourula and Suhaib Riaz posit that an ethical lens allows for a humble response, in which those with greater capacity take greater responsibility but remain inclusive and cognizant of different voices and experiences. Focussing on business ethics in connection to the grand(est) challenge of environmental emergencies, Steffen Bohm introduces the deceptively simple yet radical position that business is nature, and nature is business. His quick but profound side-step from arguments against human-nature dualism to an ontological undoing of the business-nature dichotomy should have all business ethics scholars rethinking their \"business and society\" assumptions. Also, singularly concerned with the climate emergency, Boudewijn de Bruin posits a scenario where, 40 years from now, our field will be evaluated by its ability to have helped humanity emerge from this emergency. He contends that Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth) v. Royal Dutch Shell illustrates how human rights take centre stage in climate change litigation, and how business ethics enters the courtroom. From a consumer ethics perspective, Deirdre Shaw, Michal Carrington and Louise Hassan argue that ecologically sustainable and socially just marketplace systems demand cultural change, a reconsideration of future interpretations of \"consumer society\", a challenge to the dominant \"growth logic\" and stimulation of alternative ways to address our consumption needs. Still concerned with global issues, but turning attention to social inequalities, Nelarine Cornelius links the capability approach (CA) to global and corporate governance, arguing that CA will continue to lie at the foundation of human development policy, and, increasingly, CSR and corporate governance. Continuing debate on the grand challenges associated with justice and equality, Laurence Romani identifies a significant shift in the centrality of business ethics in debates on managing (cultural) differences, positing that dialogue between diversity management and international management can ground future debate in business ethics. Finally, the essay concludes with a commentary by Charlotte Karam and Michelle Greenwood on the possibilities of feminist-inspired theories, methods, and positionality for many spheres of business ethics, not least stakeholder theory, to broaden and deepen its capacity for nuance, responsiveness, and transformation. In the words of our commentators, grand challenges must be addressed urgently, and the Journal of Business Ethics should be at the forefront of tackling them.\n",

            "Emotion regulation strategies have been characterized as adaptive or maladaptive; however, the ability to switch strategies to best suit the situation (regulatory flexibility and adaptability) underlies effective emotion regulation. Emotional intelligence may be a key capacity that enables flexible emotion regulation. We use experience sampling data from 165 participants to test whether emotional intelligence abilities (emotion understanding and management) predict variability in four emotion regulation strategies. Results show that both the emotion understanding and emotion management branches of emotional intelligence significantly relate to between-strategy variability (with moderate effect sizes), but only emotion understanding significantly predicts within-strategy variability. These findings support the hypothesis that emotional intelligence is an important predictor of the ability to flexibly vary emotion regulation depending on the situation.

However, as EI is composed of self- and other-focused dimensions, it remains unclear which dimensions are responsible for better performance and well-being. We hypothesized that other-focused EI dimensions in particular relate to task performance, whereas self-focused EI dimensions relate to employees' subjective stress and physiological responses to emotional job demands. We asked Dutch secretaries (N = 110) to professionally respond to five emotionally demanding work-related phone calls. The secretaries' skin conductance levels were recorded during the calls, and the secretaries had to indicate their stress levels after each call. Two independent raters coded the secretaries' effectiveness and the number of emotion regulation attempts during the phone calls. The results showed that other-focused emotion regulation was positively related to only one of the task performance indicators during three phone calls. In line with the hypotheses, self-focused emotion appraisal was negatively related to the secretaries' subjective stress levels after all the phone calls. Self-focused emotion regulation was positively related to the secretaries' skin conductance levels during all but one of the phone calls. This outcome suggests that self-focused EI dimensions decrease the subjective experience of stress but are accompanied by physiological costs, whereas other-focused emotion regulation may be positively but weakly related to task performance in emotionally demanding contexts.

In this paper, we investigate the extent to which an individual's choice of emotion regulation strategy is affected by factors such as emotional intelligence, the person with whom one is in conflict, situational sense of control, and the individual's aim in dealing with the conflict. A total of 300 participants (46.67% female) between the ages of 21 and 35 were recruited from the community (female's mean age = 28.14, SD = 4.49; male's mean age = 28.12, SD = 4.32). Participants filled out a set of questionnaires related to their emotion intelligence and emotion regulations they used in two interpersonal incidents with parents and partner. Structural equation modeling was used for data analyses. Results showed that positive correlation between emotional intelligence and cognitive reappraisal, in contrast to previous studies, a positive correlation between emotional intelligence and repression was found. Moreover, the person one is interacting with influences the degree to which one's sense of control impacts the choice of emotion regulation strategy. For example, in the event of conflict with one's parents, the degree of situational control has little impact on emotion regulation; however, in conflicts with spouses or partners, women have more situational control and are more likely to use cognitive reappraisal or suppression. Regarding the relationship between the goal of emotion regulation and the strategies used, this study found that they are moderated by gender and the persons involved; for example, when maintaining the relationship is the primary goal of emotion regulation, cognitive reappraisal is more likely the strategy of choice for men involved in a conflict with their partner and for women involved in a conflict with their parents. Overall, the results confirm that emotion regulation is affected by both individual and situational factors, indicating the importance of adopting a dynamic approach when investigating emotion regulation.\n",

This study (N = 178 undergraduates) examines whether ability EI (as measured by the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test) correlates with eight extrinsic regulation processes (as measured by the Regulation of Others' Emotions Scale, including downward comparison, expressive suppression, humour, distraction, direct action, reappraisal, receptive listening and valuing). Total ability EI score is significantly positively correlated with three high-engagement processes (r = .24, .40, and .16 for reappraisal, receptive listening, and valuing) and negatively correlated with two low-engagement processes (r = -.30 and -.38 for downward comparison and expressive suppression). When all four EI branches predicted each regulation process in multiple regression, only emotion management significantly predicted downward comparison, receptive listening and valuing, and only emotion management and understanding predicted expressive suppression (no significant regression coefficients for reappraisal). We conclude that the drivers of EI/extrinsic regulation associations are engagement with the target's emotion and the emotion management branch of EI.\n",

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a noninvasive and noncontact optical technique with great diagnostic potential in medicine. The combination with artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to analyze HSI data is called intelligent HSI in this article. OBJECTIVE: What are the medical applications and advantages of intelligent HSI for minimally invasive visceral surgery? MATERIAL AND METHODS: Within various clinical studies HSI data from multiple in vivo tissue types and oncological resections were acquired using an HSI camera system. Different AI algorithms were evaluated for detection and discrimination of organs, risk structures and tumors. RESULTS: In an experimental animal study 20 different organs could be differentiated with high precision (> 95%) using AI. In vivo, the parathyroid glands could be discriminated from surrounding tissue with an F1 score of 47% and sensitivity of 75%, and the bile duct with an F1 score of 79% and sensitivity of 90%. Furthermore, ex vivo tumor tissue could be successfully detected with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) larger than 0.91. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that intelligent HSI can automatically and accurately detect different tissue types. Despite great progress in the last decade intelligent HSI still has limitations. Thus, accurate AI algorithms that are easier to understand for the user and an extensive standardized and continuously growing database are needed. Further clinical studies should support the various medical applications and lead to the adoption of intelligent HSI in the clinical routine practice.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Machine learning-based clinical decision support systems (ML_CDSS) are increasingly employed in various sectors of health care aiming at supporting clinicians' practice by matching the characteristics of individual patients with a computerised clinical knowledge base. Some studies even indicate that ML_CDSS may surpass physicians' competencies regarding specific isolated tasks. From an ethical perspective, however, the usage of ML_CDSS in medical practice touches on a range of fundamental normative issues. This article aims to add to the ethical discussion by using professionalisation theory as an analytical lens for investigating how medical action at the micro level and the physician-patient relationship might be affected by the employment of ML_CDSS. MAIN TEXT: Professionalisation theory, as a distinct sociological framework, provides an elaborated account of what constitutes client-related professional action, such as medical action, at its core and why it is more than pure expertise-based action. Professionalisation theory is introduced by presenting five general structural features of professionalised medical practice: (i) the patient has a concern; (ii) the physician deals with the patient's concern; (iii) s/he gives assistance without patronising; (iv) s/he regards the patient in a holistic manner without building up a private relationship; and (v) s/he applies her/his general expertise to the particularities of the individual case. Each of these five key aspects are then analysed regarding the usage of ML_CDSS, thereby integrating the perspectives of professionalisation theory and medical ethics. CONCLUSIONS: Using ML_CDSS in medical practice requires the physician to pay special attention to those facts of the individual case that cannot be comprehensively considered by ML_CDSS, for example, the patient's personality, life situation or cultural background. Moreover, the more routinized the use of ML_CDSS becomes in clinical practice, the more that physicians need to focus on the patient's concern and strengthen patient autonomy, for instance, by adequately integrating digital decision support in shared decision-making.\n",

            "MacDonald argues that a suite of genetic and cultural adaptations among Jews constitutes a \"group evolutionary strategy.\" Their supposed genetic adaptations include, most notably, high intelligence, conscientiousness, and ethnocentrism. According to this thesis, several major intellectual and political movements, such as Boasian anthropology, Freudian psychoanalysis, and multiculturalism, were consciously or unconsciously designed by Jews to (a) promote collectivism and group continuity among themselves in Israel and the diaspora and (b) undermine the cohesion of gentile populations, thus increasing the competitive advantage of Jews and weakening organized gentile resistance (i.e., anti-Semitism). By developing and promoting these movements, Jews supposedly played a necessary role in the ascendancy of liberalism and multiculturalism in the West. While not achieving widespread acceptance among evolutionary scientists, this theory has been enormously influential in the burgeoning political movement known as the \"alt-right.\" Examination of MacDonald's argument suggests that he relies on systematically misrepresented sources and cherry-picked facts. It is argued here that the evidence favors what is termed the \"default hypothesis\": Because of their above-average intelligence and concentration in influential urban areas, Jews in recent history have been overrepresented in all major intellectual and political movements, including conservative movements, that were not overtly anti-Semitic.\n",

            "Albert Einstein's brain has long been an object of fascination to both neuroscience specialists and the general public. However, without records of advanced neuro-imaging of his brain, conclusions regarding Einstein's extraordinary cognitive capabilities can only be drawn based on the unique external features of his brain and through comparison of the external features with those of other human brain samples. The recent discovery of 14 previously unpublished photographs of Einstein's brain taken at unconventional angles by Dr. Thomas Stoltz Harvey, the pathologist, ignited a renewed frenzy about clues to explain Einstein's genius. Dr. Dean Falk and her colleagues, in their landmark paper published in Brain (2013; 136:1304-1327), described in such details about the unusual features of Einstein's brain, which shed new light on Einstein's intelligence. In this article, we ask what are the unique structures of his brain? What can we learn from this new information? Can we really explain his extraordinary cognitive capabilities based on these unique brain structures? We conclude that studying the brain of a remarkable person like Albert Einstein indeed provides us a better example to comprehensively appreciate the relationship between brain structures and advanced cognitive functions. However, caution must be exercised so as not to over-interpret his intelligence solely based on the understanding of the surface structures of his brain.\n",

I highlight some of the objections raised, and I show how the disparity between the conceptions of theoretical and empirical stages in Piaget's theory is commensurate with the fuzzy-structuralist model of the relationship between theory and empirical research conceived by Rudolf Seising on the basis of Lofti A. Zadeh's fuzzy set theory. Further, I propose a fuzzy conception of the notion 'stage', which not only captures its ordinary use in fuzzy space between theory and empirical research but also does justice to both the construct validity and quantitative variability of stages in empirical research. I therefore open a fuzzy-structuralist perspective on the Crisis of Variability afflicting Piaget's stage theory during the 1970s and conclude retrospectively that the rift it caused was not necessary since the invariance and variability of stages is not irreconcilable.\n",

Participants underwent a high-resolution structural brain imaging scan and completed a series of intelligence, creative thinking, personality, and creative achievement measures. We examined whether high and average creative achievers could be distinguished based on the relationship between morphometric brain measures (cortical area and thickness) and behavioral measures. Although participants' performance on the behavioral measures did not differ between the two groups aside from creative achievement, the relationship between posterior parietal cortex morphometry and creativity, intelligence, and personality measures depended on group membership.

MATERIALS AND METHOD: Data were collected by psychological autopsy (PA) in 16 rural counties from three provinces in China. The questionnaire was designed to investigate factors for suicide. Univariate statistical methods were used to preliminary filter factors, and BP neural network and multilayer perceptron were employed to establish the prediction model of suicide. RESULTS: The overall percentage correct of samples was 80.9% in logistic regression model. The total coincidence rate for all samples was 82.9% and the area under ROC curve was about 82.0% in the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) prediction model. The AUC of the optimal multilayer perceptron prediction model was above 90% in multilayer perceptron model. The discrimination efficiency of the multilayer perceptron model was superior to BPNN model. CONCLUSIONS: The neural network prediction models have greater accuracy than traditional methods.

In this study, an objective function optimized by a genetic algorithm was replaced with a neural network trained on real-life data. The task of the genetic algorithm is to select the optimal values of the input parameters of a neural network to ensure minimum deviation. Both input vector values and the neural network's output values are real numbers, which means the problem under consideration is regressive. The performance of three types of neural networks was analyzed: a classic multilayer perceptron network, a nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous input (NARX) prediction network, and a deep recurrent long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Algorithmic machine learning methods were used to achieve a high level of automation of the control process. By training the network on data from real measurements, we were able to control the reliability of the turning process, taking into account many factors that are usually overlooked during mathematical modelling.

            "BACKGROUND: Suicidal ideation is not restricted to psychiatric patients. To the contrary, it is not uncommon in the general population and constitutes a precursor for suicide attempts and completed suicides. While risk factors for suicidality have extensively been described, much less attention has been devoted to the investigation of protective factors. In the current study we investigated two of such potential protective factors in combination, namely trait emotional intelligence (EI) and resilience in a sample of university students. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We recruited 277 university students without an active physical or mental disorder requiring medical attention via an online questionnaire and assessed lifetime and four-week suicidal ideation. Resilience was measured with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, EI with the Self-report Emotional Ability Scale and stressful life events with the Social Readjustment Rating Scale. Logistic regression was used to investigate the effect of EI and resilience on lifetime and four-week suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Resilience as well as intrapersonal trait EI factors were significantly lower in individuals who reported lifetime suicidal ideation. The regression analysis revealed the EI facet \"Regulation of one's own emotions\" and the resilience factor \"Control\" to be significant predictors of lifetime and/or four-week suicidal ideation. Neither trait EI nor resilience had a moderating effect on the relationship between life events and suicidality. CONCLUSIONS: Low intrapersonal EI and low resilience are associated with lifetime and, in part, four-week suicidal ideation.\n",

Identifying the extent to which adolescent stress varies with trait emotional differences and the feelings of adolescents is of considerable interest in the development of intervention programs for fostering youth well-being. To attain this goal, self-reported questionnaires (perceived stress, trait EI, and positive/negative feelings) and biological measures of stress (hair cortisol concentrations, HCC) were collected from 170 adolescents (12-14 years old). Two different methodologies were conducted, which included hierarchical regression models and a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The results support trait EI as a protective factor against stress in healthy adolescents and suggest that feelings reinforce this relation. However, the debate continues regarding the possibility of optimal levels of trait EI for effective and adaptive emotional management, particularly in the emotional attention and clarity dimensions and for female adolescents.\n",

            "The influence of music genres on children's emotional intelligence is one of the hot topics in the field of multi-modal emotion research. How to fuse multi-modal information has an important impact on children's emotional analysis. Most of the current research is based on transformer, in which the self-attention mechanism module is improved to achieve the fusion effect of multi-modal information. However, it is difficult for these methods to effectively capture the effective information of different modalities. Therefore, for the task of the influence of music genres on children's emotions, this paper proposes a transformer-based multi-modal convolutional neural network. The first is to use the BiLSTM sub-network model to extract the video and audio features and use the BERT sub-network to extract the text features. Secondly, this paper uses the improved transformer cross-modal fusion module to effectively fuse different types of modal information. Finally, the transformer module is used to judge the information of different modalities and analyze the emotion from the multi-modal information. At the same time, a large number of experiments prove that the model based on multi-modal convolutional neural network proposed in this paper surpasses other methods in prediction accuracy and effectively improves the accuracy of sentiment classification tasks.\n",

For a same piece of music, different music instruments would produce different effects. Invented some 2500 years ago, Guzheng is one of the oldest music instruments in China and the world. It has distinct timbres and patterns that cannot be duplicated by other music instruments. Therefore, it is interesting to see whether AI can compose Guzheng music or alike. In this paper we present a method that can automatically compose and play Guzheng music. First, we collect a number of existing Guzheng music pieces and convert them into Music Instrument Digital Interface format. Second, we use these data to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and use the trained network to generate new Guzheng music pieces. Next, we use the Reinforcement Learning to optimize the LSTM network by adding special Guzheng playing techniques. Comparing to the existing AI methods, such as LSTM and Generative Adversary Network, our new method is more effective in capturing the characteristics of Guzheng music. According to the evaluations from skilled Guzheng players and general audiences, our Guzheng music is very close to the real Guzheng music.

In this paper, the improved deep learning algorithm is applied to the research of music score recognition. Based on the traditional neural network, the attention weight value improved convolutional neural network (CNN) and high execution efficiency deep belief network (DBN) are introduced to realize the feature extraction and intelligent recognition of music score. Taking the feature vector set extracted by CNN-DBN as input set, a feature learning algorithm based on CNN&DBN was established to extract music score. Experiments show that the proposed model in a variety of different types of polyphony music recognition showed more accurate recognition and good performance; the recognition rate of the improved algorithm applied to the soundtrack identification is as high as 98.4%, which is significantly better than those of other classic algorithms, proving that CNN&DBN can achieve better effect in music information retrieval.

Recent neurocognitive research on these constructs highlight the importance of dynamic interaction across neural network systems and the role of cognitive control processes in guiding such a dynamic interaction. How can we quantitatively examine the extent and ways in which cognitive control contributes to creativity and intelligence? To address this question, we apply a computational network control theory (NCT) approach to structural brain imaging data acquired via diffusion tensor imaging in a large sample of participants, to examine how NCT relates to individual differences in distinct measures of creative ability and intelligence. Recent application of this theory at the neural level is built on a model of brain dynamics, which mathematically models patterns of inter-region activity propagated along the structure of an underlying network. The strength of this approach is its ability to characterize the potential role of each brain region in regulating whole-brain network function based on its anatomical fingerprint and a simplified model of node dynamics. We find that intelligence is related to the ability to \"drive\" the brain system into easy to reach neural states by the right inferior parietal lobe and lower integration abilities in the left retrosplenial cortex. We also find that creativity is related to the ability to \"drive\" the brain system into difficult to reach states by the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (inferior frontal junction) and higher integration abilities in sensorimotor areas. Furthermore, we found that different facets of creativity-fluency, flexibility, and originality-relate to generally similar but not identical network controllability processes.

Here we assessed the turnover rate of D1 receptors as well as the expression level of the D1 chaperone protein (DRiP78) in the medial PPC (mPFC) of mice to determine whether rate of receptor turnover was associated with variations in the GCA of genetically heterogeneous mice. Following assessment of GCA (aggregate performance on four diverse learning tests) mice were administered an irreversible dopamine receptor antagonist (EEDQ), after which the density of new D1 receptors were quantified. GCA was positively correlated with both the rate of D1 receptor recovery and levels of DRiP78. Additionally, the density of D1 receptors was observed to increase within 60 min (or less) in response to intense demands on working memory, suggesting that a pool of immature receptors was available to accommodate high cognitive loads. These results provide evidence that innate general cognitive abilities are related to D1 receptor turnover rates in the prefrontal cortex, and that an intracellular pool of immature D1 receptors are available to accommodate cognitive demands.\n",

How variations in these phenotypes interact with variance in schizophrenia liability due to genetic or environmental factors is an area of active investigation. Studying these genetic markers using a multivariate twin modeling approach can provide novel leads for (genetic) pathways of schizophrenia development. METHODS: In a sample of 70 twins discordant for schizophrenia and 130 healthy control twins, structural equation modeling was applied to quantify unique contributions of genetic and environmental factors on human brain structure (cortical thickness, cortical surface and global white matter fractional anisotropy [FA]), intellectual ability and schizophrenia liability. RESULTS: In total, up to 28.1% of the genetic variance (22.8% of total variance) in schizophrenia liability was shared with intelligence quotient (IQ), global-FA, cortical thickness, and cortical surface. The strongest contributor was IQ, sharing on average 16.4% of the genetic variance in schizophrenia liability, followed by cortical thickness (6.3%), global-FA (4.7%) and cortical surface (0.5%). Furthermore, we found that up to 57.4% of the variation due to environmental factors (4.6% of total variance) in schizophrenia was shared with IQ (34.2%) and cortical surface (13.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Intellectual ability, FA and cortical thickness show significant and independent shared genetic variance with schizophrenia liability.

METHODS: Using standardised measures of general intelligence and performance-based executive function (EF) tests prior to starting kindergarten, 141 children born preterm (<33 weeks of gestation) and 77 term comparison children were assessed. Parental and teacher reports of executive functioning were completed when the children commenced kindergarten. The preterm and the term comparison groups were compared on measures of intelligence and EFs using independent-groups t-tests, and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify factors predictive of intelligence and executive functioning in the preterm group. RESULTS: The preterm group performed significantly more poorly than the comparison group on all intelligence and EF tests. The parental reports of the preterm and term comparison children's EF did not differ significantly, but the teachers reported elevated EF difficulties for the preterm group. Higher social risk, in particular lower educational level of the main caregiver, was the strongest predictor for the preterm children's intelligence and EF results. CONCLUSION: Social risk factors are strongly associated with impaired early EF outcomes in preterm children.\n",

            "OBJECTIVES: Preterm birth can affect cognition, but other factors including parental education and intelligence may also play a role, but few studies have adjusted for these potential confounders. We aimed to assess the impact of gestational age (GA), late preterm birth (34 to <37 weeks GA) and very to moderately preterm birth (<34 weeks GA) on intelligence, attention and executive function in a population of Danish children aged 5 years. DESIGN: Population-based prospective cohort study. SETTING: Denmark 2003-2008. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 1776 children and their mothers sampled from the Danish National Birth Cohort with information on GA, family and background factors and completed neuropsychological assessment at age 5. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised, Test of Everyday Attention for Children at Five and Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function scores. RESULTS: For preterm birth <34 weeks GA (n=8), the mean difference in full-scale intelligence quotient(IQ) was -10.6 points (95% CI -19.4 to -1.8) when compared with the term group >/=37 weeks GA (n=1728), and adjusted for potential confounders. For the teacher-assessed Global Executive Composite, the mean difference was 5.3 points (95% CI 2.4 to 8.3) in the adjusted analysis, indicating more executive function difficulties in the preterm group <34 weeks GA compared with the term group. Maternal intelligence and parental education were weak confounders. No associations between late preterm birth 34 to <37 weeks GA (n=40) and poor cognition were shown. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed substantially lower intelligence and poorer executive function in children born <34 weeks GA compared with children born at term. GA may play an important role in determining cognitive abilities independent of maternal intelligence and parental education. Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings, as the proportion of children born preterm in this study population was small.\n",

However, it remains to be established whether cognitive deficits are evident in adulthood and whether these exert a significant effect on an individual's real-lifeachievement. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, we tested a range of neurocognitive abilities, with a focus on executive function, in a sample of 122 very preterm individuals and 89 term-born controls born between 1979 and 1984. Associations between executive function and a range of achievement measures, indicative of a successful transition to adulthood, were examined. RESULTS: Very preterm adults performed worse compared to controls on measures of intellectual ability and executive function with moderate to large effect sizes. They also demonstrated significantly lower achievement levels in terms of years spent in education, employment status, and on a measure of functioning in work and social domains. Results of regression analysis indicated a stronger positive association between executive function and real-life achievement in the very preterm group compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Very preterm born adults demonstrate executive function impairments compared to full-term controls, and these are associated with lower achievement in several real-life domains.

One of the effects of climate change is an increased riverine flooding hazard, and when floods occur this has a severe impact on human lives and comes with vast economic losses. Flood resilience management procedures should be supported by a combination of complex social and environmental vulnerability assessments.

One way to achieve such inclusive procedures is by incorporating a social vulnerability evaluation methodology for environmental and flood resilience assessment. These are illustrated for application in the Polish city of Wroclaw. Socio-environmental vulnerability mapping, based on spatial analyses using the poverty risk index, data on the ageing population, as well as the distribution of the areas vulnerable to floods, was conducted with use of a location intelligence system combining Geographic Information System (GIS) and Business Intelligence (BI) tools.

Higher EI is associated with personal wellbeing and stress management, higher academic performance, stronger nursing leadership and practice performance, and greater patient safety. While there is an increasing body of evidence on nursing students' EI, there is minimal evidence on EI over time during pre-registration programs. OBJECTIVES: To measure EI in pre-registration nursing students from program commencement to conclusion to ascertain EI over time and examine the relationship between EI and academic performance. DESIGN AND SETTING: Longitudinal repeated measures study between March 2010-February 2013 at a metropolitan university in Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 111 nursing students (74.8% female) contributed data on at least two occasions. Participants were enrolled in a pre-registration Master of Nursing degree. Half the cohort (55.0%) comprised Graduate Entry students who completed the course in two years full time. The other 45% were enrolled in an undergraduate degree in arts, science or health science, combined with the same pre-registration Master of Nursing Degree. These students completed their Combined Degree program in four years full time. Participants had a mean age of 24.7years (SD=7.36). METHODS: EI was measured for commencing students (T1) using the Assessing Emotions Scale (AES), then a further three times: end of first year (T2; 9 months follow up); beginning of second year (12 months follow up; T3) and end of the program (T4; 24/36 months follow up). RESULTS: Students' EI was found to increase across the program; one subscale of EI (managing others' emotions) was related to higher academic performance; and there was a significant increase in the Utilising Emotions subscale scores over time. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-registration nurse education contributes to strengthening students' EI over time. Specific EI education scaffolded throughout programs is recommended in pre-registration curricula.\n",

            "In many social systems, groups of individuals can find remarkably efficient solutions to complex cognitive problems, sometimes even outperforming a single expert. The success of the group, however, crucially depends on how the judgments of the group members are aggregated to produce the collective answer. A large variety of such aggregation methods have been described in the literature, such as averaging the independent judgments, relying on the majority or setting up a group discussion. In the present work, we introduce a novel approach for aggregating judgments-the transmission chain-which has not yet been consistently evaluated in the context of collective intelligence. In a transmission chain, all group members have access to a unique collective solution and can improve it sequentially. Over repeated improvements, the collective solution that emerges reflects the judgments of every group members. We address the question of whether such a transmission chain can foster collective intelligence for binary-choice problems. In a series of numerical simulations, we explore the impact of various factors on the performance of the transmission chain, such as the group size, the model parameters, and the structure of the population. The performance of this method is compared to those of the majority rule and the confidence-weighted majority. Finally, we rely on two existing datasets of individuals performing a series of binary decisions to evaluate the expected performances of the three methods empirically. We find that the parameter space where the transmission chain has the best performance rarely appears in real datasets. We conclude that the transmission chain is best suited for other types of problems, such as those that have cumulative properties.\n",

Here, we use homing pigeons to investigate whether the repeated removal and replacement of individuals in experimental groups (a key method in testing for CCE) alters the groups' solution efficiency over successive generations. Homing performance improves continuously over generations, and later-generation groups eventually outperform both solo individuals and fixed-membership groups. Homing routes are more similar in consecutive generations within the same chains than between chains, indicating cross-generational knowledge transfer. Our findings thus show that collective intelligence in animal groups can accumulate progressive modifications over time. Furthermore, our results satisfy the main criteria for CCE and suggest potential mechanisms for CCE that do not rely on complex cognition.\n",

            "Innovation is often assumed to be the work of a talented few, whose products are passed on to the masses. Here, we argue that innovations are instead an emergent property of our species' cultural learning abilities, applied within our societies and social networks. Our societies and social networks act as collective brains. We outline how many human brains, which evolved primarily for the acquisition of culture, together beget a collective brain. Within these collective brains, the three main sources of innovation are serendipity, recombination and incremental improvement. We argue that rates of innovation are heavily influenced by (i) sociality, (ii) transmission fidelity, and (iii) cultural variance. We discuss some of the forces that affect these factors. These factors can also shape each other. For example, we provide preliminary evidence that transmission efficiency is affected by sociality--languages with more speakers are more efficient. We argue that collective brains can make each of their constituent cultural brains more innovative. This perspective sheds light on traits, such as IQ, that have been implicated in innovation. A collective brain perspective can help us understand otherwise puzzling findings in the IQ literature, including group differences, heritability differences and the dramatic increase in IQ test scores over time.\n",

The relationships between the variables were analyzed and a structural equation model was developed. The correlations revealed that there was a positive relationship between EI and student academic performance, but there was also a negative relationship regarding cybervictimization. In other words, students with lower EI were more likely to suffer from cybervictimization and could experience negative repercussions on school success.

METHODS: Data was collected from 100 female athletes participating in sprints.The emotional intelligence in athletes was measured by the Bar-On questionnaire, the reaction time was assessed by the psychomotor vigilance task, and maximal aerobic capacity was predicted by step test. Pearson correlation calculations were conducted to investigate the potential relationships between emotional intelligence total score, reaction time, and estimated VO2max, with recorded time of the students. RESULTS: Average age of female athletes was 20.59 years (+/-1.55) and mean height of them was 163.63 cm (+/-6.03).The mean emotional intelligence in athletes was 302.05 (+/-20.18), the mean reaction time was 431.14 ms (+/-114.88), and mean maximal aerobic capacity was predicted as 62.82 ml/ kg.min (+/-0.6). The findings revealed that there is no significant correlation between emotional intelligence and recorded time or athletic performance (p > 0.05).There were significant correlations between some components of emotional intelligence (empathy, interpersonal relations, and independence) and athletes' recorded time.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify current frameworks guiding the application and evaluation of AI for predictive analytics in medicine and to describe the content of these frameworks. We also assessed what stages along the AI translational spectrum (ie, AI development, reporting, evaluation, implementation, and surveillance) the content of each framework has been discussed. METHODS: We performed a literature review of frameworks regarding the oversight of AI in medicine. The search included key topics such as \"artificial intelligence,\" \"machine learning,\" \"guidance as topic,\" and \"translational science,\" and spanned the time period 2014-2022. Documents were included if they provided generalizable guidance regarding the use or evaluation of AI in medicine. Included frameworks are summarized descriptively and were subjected to content analysis. A novel evaluation matrix was developed and applied to appraise the frameworks' coverage of content areas across translational stages. RESULTS: Fourteen frameworks are featured in the review, including six frameworks that provide descriptive guidance and eight that provide reporting checklists for medical applications of AI. Content analysis revealed five considerations related to the oversight of AI in medicine across frameworks: transparency, reproducibility, ethics, effectiveness, and engagement. All frameworks include discussions regarding transparency, reproducibility, ethics, and effectiveness, while only half of the frameworks discuss engagement. The evaluation matrix revealed that frameworks were most likely to report AI considerations for the translational stage of development and were least likely to report considerations for the translational stage of surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Existing frameworks for the application and evaluation of AI in medicine notably offer less input on the role of engagement in oversight and regarding the translational stage of surveillance. Identifying and optimizing strategies for engagement are essential to ensure that AI can meaningfully benefit patients and other end users.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Vocabulary scores increase until approximately age 65 years and then remain stable or decrease slightly, unlike scores on tests of other cognitive abilities that decline significantly with age. AIMS: To review the findings on ageing-related changes in vocabulary, and to discuss four methodological issues: research design; test type; measurement; and vocabulary ability as a proxy for general intelligence. MAIN CONTRIBUTION: A discussion of cross-sectional and longitudinal research designs shows that cohort membership accounts for some but not all ageing-related changes in vocabulary, and that drop-out and test-retest effects do not alter conclusions regarding these changes. Test type affects age trends in vocabulary, and if researchers use only one test, they should choose a multiple-choice synonym test. While some authors suggest that vocabulary tests do not measure the same underlying ability in younger and older adults, more research of this suggestion is needed. A brief examination of the use of vocabulary ability as a proxy for general intelligence in healthy ageing and for premorbid abilities in dementia indicates that such practice is often questionable. CONCLUSIONS: Vocabulary knowledge increases through the mid-60s regardless of measurement method. However, there is little information on how word knowledge serves other verbal skills in old age, how and when adults learn new words, or how much exposure is necessary for meanings to remain in storage for a lifetime. Research of these issues may require new methodologies, as well as novel theoretical accounts of ageing-related effects on vocabulary. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on this subject Unlike many cognitive abilities that decline with ageing, vocabulary knowledge continues to increase until approximately age 65, and then remains stable or decreases slightly. These findings have been replicated in different research designs and across languages. What this paper adds to existing knowledge The article presents a summary of findings on changes in vocabulary across adulthood, and a discussion of four key methodological issues: research design, test type, measurement, and the use of vocabulary ability as a proxy for general intelligence. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? To better understand changes in vocabulary knowledge across adulthood, clinicians must be aware of methodological considerations that affect the field. Such considerations have direct clinical implications regarding the choice of vocabulary tests and their use as a proxy for other abilities in both healthy older adults and in individuals with dementia.\n",

While much research has focused on the role of teachers and parents, it is unclear how implicit theories of intelligence operate in the peer context. AIMS: This study examined the effects of peers' mindsets on students' learning outcomes. We predicted that participants surrounded by peers endorsing a growth mindset would show increased learning outcomes; in contrast, such outcomes would be dampened for individuals in a fixed mindset peer context. We also expected that perceptions of peers' competence would serve as a mechanism underlying the effects of growth mindset. SAMPLE: A total of 134 undergraduate students (88 females) participated in the study. Students were of diverse ethnic background. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions where they interacted with trained confederates who endorsed either a growth or fixed mindset viewpoint. Confederates were trained to include specific phrases regarding the nature of ability in a conversation they had with the participants. Participants subsequently completed a problem-solving task and a survey. RESULTS: Participants who interacted with peers endorsing a growth (vs. fixed) mindset viewpoint showed increased task value on the problem-solving task. Perceptions of peers' competence mediated the relationship between a growth mindset peer context and participants' task value. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide preliminary evidence that peer mindsets can influence individuals' valuing of a task. As such, peers may be an important resource to be considered when designing growth mindset interventions.\n",

            "Studies over the past three decades have shown that learning difficulties are not only determined by neurological disorders, but also by motivational and/or socio-cognitive factors Among these factors, implicit theories of intelligence (also referred to as conceptions, mindsets or beliefs about intelligence) are key elements. The belief that intelligence is fixed (entity theory), as opposed to malleable (incremental theory), is generally associated with negative teaching practices and poorer student outcomes, yet beliefs about the intelligence of individuals with intellectual disabilities have not received much attention. We propose the first study on conceptions of intelligence of persons with intellectual disabilities, here people with Down syndrome. Participants were 55 professionally qualified people working with individuals with intellectual disabilities and 81 adults from the community. We compared what both groups of participants believe about intelligence of typical people and what they believe about the intelligence of individuals with Down syndrome. We also investigated implicit theories of intelligence as predictors of explicit judgments about intelligence and implicit attitudes toward people with Down syndrome. Whatever the work experience in the field of intellectual disability, implicit theories of intelligence were found to be less incremental when considering people with Down syndrome than when considering typical people; and the stronger the belief in entity theory, the more negative (and less positive) the judgments expressed explicitly. Implicit theories of intelligence were also found to be predictors of negative implicit attitude but only in adults from the community. These findings offer prospects for improving practices by people working in the field of intellectual disability. They might interest a wide range of people caring for people with intellectual disabilities, such as teachers, but also other professional caregivers, and other scientists focusing on intellectual disabilities or social cognition.\n",

What about writing? Do people hold similar implicit theories about the nature of their writing ability? Furthermore, are these beliefs likely to influence students' response to a writing intervention? AIMS: We aimed to develop a scale to measure students' implicit theories of writing (pilot study) and to test whether these beliefs influence strategy-instruction effectiveness (intervention study). SAMPLE: In the pilot and intervention studies participated, respectively, 128 and 192 students (Grades 5-6). METHOD: Based on existing instruments that measure self-theories of intelligence, we developed the Implicit Theories of Writing (ITW) scale that was tested with the pilot sample. In the intervention study, 109 students received planning instruction based on the self-regulated strategy development model, whereas 83 students received standard writing instruction. Students were evaluated before, in the middle, and after instruction. RESULTS: ITW's validity was supported by piloting results and their successful cross-validation in the intervention study. In this, intervention students wrote longer and better texts than control students. Moreover, latent growth curve modelling showed that the more the intervention students conceived writing as a malleable skill, the more the quality of their texts improved. CONCLUSION: This research is of educational relevance because it provides a measure to evaluate students' implicit theories of writing and shows their impact on response to intervention.\n",

            "Beliefs about how much people can change their attributes - implicit theories - influence affective and cognitive responses to performance and subsequent motivation. Those who believe their attributes are fixed view setbacks as threatening and avoid challenging situations. In contrast, those who believe these attributes are malleable embrace challenges as opportunities to grow. Although implicit theories would seem to have important mental health implications, the research linking them with clinical applications is limited. To address this gap, we assessed how implicit theories of anxiety, emotion, intelligence, and personality related to various symptoms of anxiety and depression, emotion-regulation strategies, and hypothetical treatment choices (e.g., medication versus therapy) in two undergraduate samples. Across both samples, individuals who believed their attributes could change reported fewer mental health symptoms, greater use of cognitive reappraisal, and were more likely to choose individual therapy over medication. These findings suggest that implicit theories may play an important role in the nature and treatment of mental health problems.\n",

We examined self-reported symptoms of alexithymia in adults with agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC), a condition characterized by more subtle reductions in interhemispheric transfer than in commissurotomy. Sixteen adults with AgCC and full-scale intelligence quotient >80 were compared with 15 neurotypical controls group-matched for age and intelligence score. The AgCC group endorsed greater difficulty identifying and describing feelings and more vague physical symptoms than controls but similar levels of emotional experience and emotional coping. This finding of impaired emotional interpretation with intact emotional experience is consistent with findings in callosotomy patients, implicating the critical role of the corpus callosum in cognitive dimensions of emotion processing.

            "It has been asserted that the socio-emotional challenges associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be explained, in part, by the higher rates of alexithymia in individuals with autism. Alexithymia refers to difficulties in identifying one's own emotional states and describing those states to others. Thus, one goal of the present study was to examine levels of alexithymia in relation to ASD symptomatology and trait emotion intelligence (EI). Trait EI is a multifaceted concept that captures emotional competencies and behavioral dispositions A second goal was to assess whether alexithymia, ASD symptomatology and trait EI served as significant predictors of adjustment to college, including academic, social, and personal-emotional adjustment. In addition to keeping with the spectrum nature of autism, our research strategy allowed us to capture those students who may not have received a formal diagnosis of ASD but report symptoms that can be indicative of ASD. This includes women, who are less likely to receive a diagnosis of ASD even when ASD symptomatology is present. The results of the study showed that students reporting higher levels of ASD symptomatology also reported significantly higher levels of alexithymia and lower trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) than those with less or no symptomatology. Alexithymia was also negatively related to trait EI, and both alexithymia and ASD symptomatology were found to be significant predictors of trait EI. However, only trait EI was a significant predictor of adjustment to college and only for social adjustment. These findings suggest that support programs that develop trait EI skills may improve the college experience for students with ASD, regardless of alexithymia or ASD symptomatology.\n",

            "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Immigration in Europe is a challenge for health care systems. Psychotic experiences are not uncommon in the community. Meta-analyses showed that immigrants are at higher risk of psychotic symptoms and experiences than natives. In the international literature, there is little knowledge about the psychological processes explaining the relationship between immigrant status and psychotic experiences. Aberrant salience, the biased assignment of significance to otherwise innocuous stimuli, and alexithymia (difficulty identifying/verbalizing feelings and concrete speech/thinking) have been found to be vulnerability/maintenance factors of psychotic symptoms. This report presents a study investigating whether: 1) adolescent immigrants in Italy report more intense psychotic experiences than natives; 2) aberrant salience and alexithymia predict more intense psychotic experiences; and 3) these psychological processes moderate the effect of immigrant status on psychotic experiences. Knowledge about the role of these processes in psychotic experiences may suggest early detection or prevention strategies. METHODS: One hundred and forty-eight community adolescents were recruited (mean age =17.57 years, 47.30% females); of these, 75 were born in Italy (natives) and 73 were immigrants (born in countries other than Italy). The Aberrant Salience Inventory, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20, and the Screening for Psychotic Experiences were administered in classrooms. RESULTS: Immigrants had higher aberrant salience (F=4.38, p<0.05), alexithymia (F=8.93, p<0.01), and psychotic experiences (F=10.65, p<0.01) than natives. Higher aberrant salience and alexithymia predicted more intense psychotic experiences. An interaction effect between immigrant status and alexithymia emerged: immigrants with higher alexithymia had more intense psychotic experiences (beta=0.17, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Early detection or prevention programs should focus on aberrant salience in the adolescent population and should consider young immigrants with higher alexithymia as a subgroup with higher psychotic experiences. Mindfulness-based programs may be implemented for this adolescent subgroup to promote emotional intelligence.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Depression is more than just sentiment sad or passing a rough patch. It is a serious psychological wellbeing disorder that needs curative care and maintenance. Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a comprehensive personality construct denoting the capability to perceive and control affects within the self. Alexithymia is another personality construct that refers to the difficulty of recognizing and expressing feelings, with an outside oriented thinking style. Suicidal ideation is defined as thinking of appealing in conduct intentional to end one's life. AIM: The current study aimed to examine the relationship between emotional intelligence, alexithymia and suicidal ideation among depressive patients. DESIGN: A descriptive correlation design was utilized. SETTING: This study was conducted at the Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic in El Ahrar Hospital, Alsharkia Governorate, Egypt. SUBJECTS: A purposeful sample of 65 depressed patients was recruited for this study. TOOLS: Data were collected by using four tools: Socio-demographic Data Sheet, Emotional Intelligence Scales, Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and Suicidal Ideation Scale. RESULTS: The majority of depressed patients were having alexithymia and having low emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence was statistically significantly negatively correlated with alexithymia and suicidal ideation. Nevertheless, alexithymia was statistically significantly positively correlated with suicidal ideation. It was statistically significantly positively predictor of suicidal ideation and alexithymia, while it was statistically significantly negatively predictor of suicidal ideation and emotional intelligence. CONCLUSION: Lower emotional intelligence led to higher suicidal ideation in depressive patients. Increasing alexithymia in patients with depressive disorders caused an increase in their suicidal ideation. Therefore, it is recommended implementing a training program such as mindfulness and emotional intelligence skills for patients to enhance their emotional intelligence.\n",

BACKGROUND: Relationship conflicts that exist in the nursing teamwork cannot be ignored. It would lead to poor teamwork and impact on patients' poor outcomes. In the meantime, cultural intelligence has been proven that people who have a higher cultural intelligence can do better at the work. METHODS: The sample included 550 clinic nurses from five different hospitals in Shanghai. The Cultural Intelligence Scale, the Relationship Conflict Scale, and the Nursing Teamwork Survey Scale were used to investigate. Through the Johnson-Neyman method and SPSS Process Macro, the moderating effect of cultural intelligence was analysed. RESULTS: The findings showed that cultural intelligence was founded to be significant (b = 2.03, p < 0.01). When the cultural intelligence score is greater than or equal to 90.8, the relationship conflict between nurses will not affect teamwork. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study may provide data to improve nurses' performance in team cooperation. IMPLICATION FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nursing managers should pay attention to the construction of the nurse's cultural intelligence. Nursing managers should guide nurses in daily work to continuously develop their own cultural intelligence.

            "This study aims to explore the influence mechanism of cultural intelligence on work-family conflict for Chinese expatriates in cross-cultural non-profit organizations. Drawing on conservation of resources theory, this longitudinal study (six-month time lag) is the first to examine cultural intelligence as an antecedent of work-family conflict. The study also examines the mediating role of work engagement and the moderating role of leader-member exchange (LMX) in the cultural intelligence and work-family conflict relationship. The sample comprises 206 expatriate Chinese language teachers working at 45 Confucius Institutes in the US, Canada, and Russia. Results show that cultural intelligence not only reduces work-family conflict but also promotes expatriates' work engagement. The higher the work engagement, the higher the work-family conflict experienced by expatriates. LMX moderates not only the positive relationship between work engagement and work-family conflict but also the indirect effect of cultural intelligence on work-family conflict through work engagement. Thus, the indirect effect of cultural intelligence on work-family conflict through work engagement is stronger with low (compared to high) LMX.

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of being born small for gestational age (SGA), with or without intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) on cognitive ability in late adolescence. STUDY DESIGN: A follow-up study of a former cohort included 123 participants (52 males); 47 born SGA and 76 born appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Fetal growth velocity (FGV) was determined by serial ultrasound measurements during the third trimester. A control group matched for age and birthplace was included. The original Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) was administered, and verbal, performance and full-scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores were calculated. RESULTS: There was no difference in IQ between adolescents born SGA and AGA. FGV or IUGR during the third trimester did not influence cognitive ability in late adolescence. Full-scale IQ was positively related to head circumference (HC) in adolescence (B: 1.30, 95% CI: 0.32-2.28, p=0.01). HC at birth and three months was positively associated with full-scale IQ. Catch-up growth in the group of SGA children was associated with a significantly increased height, larger HC, increased levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and increased full-scale IQ compared to those born SGA without catch-up growth. CONCLUSION: SGA and IUGR may not be harmful for adult cognitive ability, at least not in individuals born at near-term. However, known risk factors of impaired fetal growth may explain the link between early growth and cognitive ability in adulthood.\n",

Group differences were analyzed using a general linear model, controlling for sex and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: The SGA group had lower full IQ scores than the control group (mean difference, -6.3; 95% CI, -2.8 to -9.7; P = .001), including lower scores on 6 of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition subtests. In the SGA subgroup with repeated ultrasound measures, 6 of 29 subjects (21%) had IUGR, and these subjects also had a lower IQ compared with controls (mean difference, -14.0; 95% CI: -4.8 to -23.3; P = .003).

Weight, length, and head circumference (HC) of the infants were measured at 9 time points between birth and 5 years. The growth was determined as a z score change between measurement points. Cognitive development was assessed at 5 years of age with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence-Revised. The association between growth and full-scale IQ (FSIQ) was studied. RESULTS: Growth in length and height was not associated with 5-year cognitive outcome. However, weight (r = 0.18, P = .04) and HC growth (r = 0.25, P = .01) between birth and 2 years of corrected age correlated to FSIQ in non-SGA children. In SGA children, HC growth (r = 0.33, P = .03) around term age correlated to FSIQ. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive outcome was similar in SGA and non-SGA very preterm infants. Growth affected cognition positively in both subgroups, but the critical time period was different.\n",

            "Caffeine is the most widely used drug by both adults and children worldwide due to its ability to promote alertness and elevate moods. It is effective in the management of apnea of prematurity in premature infants. Caffeine for apnea of prematurity reduces the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in very-low-birth-weight infants and improves survival without neurodevelopmental disability at 18-21 months. Follow-up studies of the infants in the Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity trial highlight the long-term safety of caffeine in these infants, especially relating to motor, behavioral, and intelligence skills. However, in animal models, exposure to caffeine during pregnancy and lactation adversely affects neuronal development and adult behavior of their offspring. Prenatal caffeine predisposes to intrauterine growth restriction and small growth for gestational age at birth. However, in-utero exposure to caffeine is also associated with excess growth, obesity, and cardio-metabolic changes in children. Caffeine therapy is a significant advance in newborn care, conferring immediate benefits in preterm neonates. Studies should help define the appropriate therapeutic window for caffeine treatment along with with the mechanisms relating to its beneficial effects on the brain and the lung. The long-term consequences of caffeine in adults born preterm are being studied and may depend on the ability of caffeine to modulate both the expression and the maturation of adenosine receptors in infants treated with caffeine.\n",

However, no randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study has looked at the effects of tDCS on a comprehensive battery of cognitive processes. The objective of this study was to test if tDCS had an effect on performance on a comprehensive assay of cognitive processes, a standardized intelligence quotient (IQ) test. The study consisted of two substudies and followed a double-blind, between-subjects, sham-controlled design. In total, 41 healthy adult participants were included in the final analysis. These participants completed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) as a baseline measure. At least one week later, participants in substudy 1 received either bilateral tDCS (anodes over both F4 and F3, cathode over Cz, 2 mA at each anode for 20 min) or active sham tDCS (2 mA for 40 s), and participants in substudy 2 received either right or left tDCS (anode over either F4 or F3, cathode over Cz, 2 mA for 20 min). In both studies, the WAIS-IV was immediately administered following stimulation to assess for performance differences induced by bilateral and unilateral tDCS. Compared to sham stimulation, right, left, and bilateral tDCS reduced improvement between sessions on Full Scale IQ and the Perceptual Reasoning Index. This demonstration that frontal tDCS selectively degraded improvement on specific metrics of the WAIS-IV raises important questions about the often proposed role of tDCS in cognitive enhancement.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Higher early-life intelligence is associated with a reduced risk of mortality in adulthood, though this association is apparently hardly attenuated when accounting for early-life socio-economic status (SES). However, the use of proxy measures of SES means that residual confounding may underestimate this attenuation. In the present study, the potential confounding effect of early-life SES was instead accounted for by examining the intelligence-mortality association within families. METHODS: The association between early-life intelligence and mortality in adulthood was assessed in 727 members of the 6-Day Sample of the Scottish Mental Survey 1947 and, for the first time, 1580 of their younger siblings. These individuals were born between 1936 and 1958, and were followed up into later life, with deaths recorded up to 2015. Cox regression was used to estimate the relative risk of mortality associated with higher IQ scores after adjusting for shared family factors. RESULTS: A standard-deviation advantage in IQ score was associated with a significantly reduced mortality risk [hazard ratio = 0.76, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.68-0.84)]. This reduction in hazard was only slightly attenuated by adjusting for sex and shared family factors [hazard ratio = 0.79, p = 0.002, 95% CI (0.68-0.92)]. CONCLUSIONS: Although somewhat conservative, adjusting for all variance shared by a family avoids any potential residual confounding of the intelligence-mortality association arising from the use of proxy measures of early-life SES. The present study demonstrates that the longevity associated with higher early-life intelligence cannot be explained by early-life SES or within-family factors.\n",

However, there is a paucity of evidence on social participation in youth in relation to mortality, which could help inform an understanding of the origin of the association and give credence to causality. The present study investigates the relation of early-life club membership-a proxy measure of social participation-with mortality risk in older age in a nationally representative sample. METHODS: We linked historical data collected on the 6-Day Sample of the Scottish Mental Survey 1947 during the period 1947 to 1963 with vital status records up to April 2014.

            "In studies of cognitive ageing it is useful and important to know how stable are the individual differences in cognitive ability from childhood to older age, and also to be able to estimate (retrodict) prior cognitive ability differences from those in older age. Here we contribute to these aims with new data from a follow-up study of the 6-Day Sample of the Scottish Mental Survey of 1947 (original N = 1208). The sample had cognitive, educational, social, and occupational data collected almost annually from age 11 to 27 years. Whereas previous long-term follow-up studies of the Scottish mental surveys are based upon group-administered cognitive tests at a mean age of 11 years, the present sample each had an individually-administered revised Binet test. We traced them for vital status in older age, and some agreed to take several mental tests at age 77 years (N = 131). The National Adult Reading Test at age 77 correlated .72 with the Terman-Merrill revision of the Binet Test at age 11. Adding the Moray House Test No. 12 score from age 11 and educational information took the multiple R to .81 between youth and older age. The equivalent multiple R for fluid general intelligence was .57. When the NART from age 77 was the independent variable (retrodictor) along with educational attainment, the multiple R with the Terman-Merrill IQ at age 11 was .75. No previous studies of the stability of intelligence from childhood to old age, or of the power of the NART to retrodict prior intelligence, have had individually-administered IQ data from youth. About two-thirds, at least, of the variation in verbal ability in old age can be captured by cognitive and educational information from youth. Non-verbal ability is less well predicted. A short test of pronunciation-the NART-and brief educational information can capture well over half of the variation in IQ scores obtained 66 years earlier.\n",

            "In 1932 and again in 1947, the Scottish Council for Research in Education conducted the Scottish Mental Surveys. Testing two cohorts, one in 1932 and another in 1947, researchers set out to measure-using the same validated test each time-the intelligence of every Scottish child 11 years of age. The stated impetus for the Surveys was a fear that average Scottish intelligence was declining. But when investigators compared the results of the 1947 Survey with those from 1932 their predictions were completely upended. Instead of average intelligence declining, it had risen, substantially. The author argues that based on a study of the relevant ecosystems in place in Scotland at the time the increase in intelligence resulted from a decline in lead body burden. There is no evidence that the children were tested for lead. The decline is thought to have closely followed a fall in occupational lead use, a heightened awareness of the dangers of lead-solvency, improvements in lead plumbing in working-class homes, and a national campaign to improve the nutrition of women and children. Evidence shows that milk consumption in Scotland increased sharply, especially among children, beginning in the mid-1930s, just prior to and following the birth of the second cohort. This provided a source of calcium in a diet that had shown signs of deficiency. Evidence also suggests that lead contamination, from lead water pipes and industrial sources, was widely prevalent in Scotland in the early part of the twentieth century.\n",

A mixed-model ANCOVA revealed significant differences in DT performance for the balance and the MOT task between both groups.

Exploiting the traditional MOT task's ability to characterize the allocation of attentional resources to task demands, the current study compared learning exhibited on an attention-based task across neurodevelopmental conditions defined by deficits in attention (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; ADHD), learning (specific learning disorder; SLD), and intelligence (intellectual developmental disorder; IDD). Children and adolescents (N = 101) completed 15 sessions on a Multiple Object-Tracking (MOT) task where performance trajectories were analyzed using latent growth curve modeling and conditioned by the presence of ADHD, SLD, or IDD while controlling for performance on a separate measure of attention, age, and sex. The sample, characterized by below-average IQ and problematic levels of attention, exhibited an effect of learning on MOT. However, individuals with an IDD diagnosis demonstrated decreased baseline MOT capability while ADHD and SLD profiles exhibited decreased slopes, relative to other neurodevelopmental conditions. Taken together, the results demonstrate distinct linear performance trajectories between neurodevelopmental conditions defined by deficits in attention, learning, and intelligence. The current study provides additional evidence to repurpose the traditional MOT task as a descriptor of attention and discusses alternative uses for the paradigm. Overall, these results suggest an eclectic approach that considers attention, learning, and higher-order cognition when diagnosing ADHD, SLD, or IDD.\n",

            "Human fluid intelligence is closely linked to the sequential solving of complex problems. It has been associated with a distributed cognitive control or multiple-demand (MD) network, comprising regions of lateral frontal, insular, dorsomedial frontal, and parietal cortex. Previous neuroimaging research suggests that the MD network may orchestrate the allocation of attentional resources to individual parts of a complex task: in a complex target detection task with multiple independent rules, applied one at a time, reduced response to rule-critical events across the MD network in lower fluid intelligence was observed. This was in particular the case with increasing task complexity (i.e., larger sets of rules), and was accompanied by impairment in performance. Here, we examined the early spatiotemporal neural dynamics of this process in electroencephalography (EEG) source analyses using a similar task paradigm. Levels of fluid intelligence specifically predicted early neural responses in a left inferiorparietal MD region around 200-300 ms post stimulus onset. Evoked source amplitudes in left parietal cortex within this early time window also correlated with behavioural performance measures. Like in previous research, we observed impaired performance in lower fluid intelligence with increasing number of task rules. This links fluid intelligence to a process of attentional focus on those parts of a task that are most critical for the current behaviour. Within the MD system, our time re-resolved measures suggest that the left parietal cortex specifically impacts on early processes of attentional focus on task critical features. This is novel evidence on the neurocognitive correlates of fluid intelligence suggesting that individual differences are critically linked to an early process of attentional focus on task-relevant information, which is supported by left parietal MD regions.\n",

            "OBJECTIVES: Past research suggests that youth with sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs) present with verbal fluency deficits. However, most studies have focused on sex chromosome trisomies. Far less is known about sex chromosome tetrasomies and pentasomies. Thus, the current research sought to characterize verbal fluency performance among youth with sex chromosome trisomies, tetrasomies, and pentasomies by contrasting how performance varies as a function of extra X number and X versus Y status. METHODS: Participants included 79 youth with SCAs and 42 typically developing controls matched on age, maternal education, and racial/ethnic background. Participants completed the phonemic and semantic conditions of a verbal fluency task and an abbreviated intelligence test. RESULTS: Both supernumerary X and Y chromosomes were associated with verbal fluency deficits relative to controls. These impairments increased as a function of the number of extra X chromosomes, and the pattern of impairments on phonemic and semantic fluency differed for those with a supernumerary X versus Y chromosome. Whereas one supernumerary Y chromosome was associated with similar performance across fluency conditions, one supernumerary X chromosome was associated with relatively stronger semantic than phonemic fluency skills. CONCLUSIONS: Verbal fluency skills in youth with supernumerary X and Y chromosomes are impaired relative to controls. However, the degree of impairment varies across groups and task condition. Further research into the cognitive underpinnings of verbal fluency in youth with SCAs may provide insights into their verbal fluency deficits and help guide future treatments.

Children who received a relatively high proportion of process praise (e.g., praise for effort and strategies) showed stronger incremental motivational frameworks, including a belief that intelligence can be developed and a greater desire for challenge, when they were in 2nd or 3rd grade (Gunderson et al., 2013). The current study examines these same children's (n = 53) academic achievement 1 to 2 years later, in 4th grade. Results provide the first evidence that process praise to toddlers predicts children's academic achievement (in math and reading comprehension) 7 years later, in elementary school, via their incremental motivational frameworks. Further analysis of these motivational frameworks shows that process praise had its effect on fourth grade achievement through children's trait beliefs (e.g., believing that intelligence is fixed vs. malleable), rather than through their learning goals (e.g., preference for easy vs. challenging tasks).

However, the influences of parental criticism, as well as different forms of praise and criticism (e.g., process vs. person), have received less attention. We examine these associations by analyzing two existing datasets (Study 1: N = 317 first to eighth graders; Study 2: N = 282 fifth and eighth graders). In both studies, older children held more incremental theories of intelligence, but lower learning goals, than younger children. Unexpectedly, the relation between theories of intelligence and learning goals was nonsignificant and did not vary with children's grade level. In both studies, overall perceived parent praise positively related to children's learning goals, whereas perceived parent criticism negatively related to incremental theories of intelligence. In Study 2, perceived parent process praise was the only significant (positive) predictor of children's learning goals, whereas perceived parent person criticism was the only significant (negative) predictor of incremental theories of intelligence. Finally, Study 2 provided some support for our hypothesis that age-related differences in perceived parent praise and criticism can explain age-related differences in children's learning goals. Results suggest that incremental theories of intelligence and learning goals might not be strongly related during childhood and that perceived parent praise and criticism have important, but distinct, relations with each motivational construct.\n",

Whether premorbid maladjustment is associated with interpersonal functioning problems that manifest during the first episode of psychosis is less well-established. No previous work has investigated the relationship between premorbid adjustment and a key component of social cognition (emotion management) during the early phase of schizophrenia. A sample of 119 individuals (40 experiencing a first episode of schizophrenia, FE-SZ, 22 experiencing a first episode of another psychotic disorder, FE-OP, and 57 healthy controls, HC) participated in an assessment of premorbid adjustment and emotion management, measured using the Cannon-Spoor Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS) and the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) Managing Emotions (ME) scale. The relationship between premorbid adjustment (from age 5 to onset of psychotic symptoms) and ME was examined, as well as the specific relationship between childhood premorbid adjustment (ages 5-11) and ME. Results indicated that both FE-SZ and FE-OP participants exhibited significantly worse premorbid adjustment (all p's < 0.01) across development and lower ME scores when compared to HC participants. Among FE-SZ participants only, premorbid maladjustment in childhood was correlated with deficits in emotion management. This study is the first to suggest that poor premorbid social and academic functioning in childhood is related to later deficits in emotion management in those experiencing a first episode of schizophrenia.

Participants took part in a structured interview based on a structured interview guide created for the purpose of this study. The standardized psychological questionnaires NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) and Schutte Emotional Intelligence Scale (SEIS) were used. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: The caregiver's positive attitude towards the PWA correlated with the active facilitation of communication. The personality traits of caregivers and their level of emotional intelligence were associated with the tendency to use certain techniques to facilitate communication with PWA. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: Caregivers' positive attitude towards PWA is beneficial for the rehabilitation of communicative functions. Personality traits and emotional intelligence could modify the caregiver's strategy of coping with aphasia-related challenges and should be taken into consideration when providing support. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject Interpersonal communication must by definition involve at least two people. Therefore, there are a lot of approaches in SLT where support is given not only to the PWA but also to the communication partners. The most important group is significant others, which is usually understood as family members and friends. There is an increasing recognition that SLTs should include them in therapy. What this paper adds to existing knowledge For those PWA who need constant care, caregivers may have a significant influence on the quality of communication. Their positive attitude towards PWA corresponds with more active facilitation of communication and can make rehabilitation more efficacious. Caregivers should be educated on the cognitive and behavioural aspects of aphasia and encouraged to look actively for a PWA's positive characteristics. Caregivers' personality traits play a role in facilitating communication. For example, caregivers with high agreeableness are more likely to enjoy providing care, while those with higher conscientiousness declare using more techniques to facilitate communication with the PWA. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Caregivers' personality traits play a role in caring. Their positive attitude towards PWA corresponds to more active facilitation of communication, which can lead to more effective rehabilitation. This should be taken into account when training caregivers. Training programmes should include cognitive and behavioural aspects of aphasia as well as emphasize the need to maximize the PWA's abilities.\n",

            "Mentalizing abilities are severely disrupted in patients with schizophrenia, but gender-related differences in this domain are virtually unexplored. Given the importance of these abilities in understanding psychopathology, social functioning and outcome, this study aimed to examine the mentalizing abilities of male and female patients with schizophrenia. The cognitive and affective mentalizing abilities of self and other of clinically stable male and female patients with schizophrenia were analyzed using the abbreviated version of the Metacognitive Assessment Scale (MAS-A). Compared to their male counterparts, the female patients demonstrated superior overall mentalizing abilities. This advantage was also evident when mentalizing about the Self or the Other. When examining cognitive versus affective mentalizing, women were significantly better in their ability to attribute and understand the affective mental states of others. These differences were unrelated to intelligence or psychopathology. The superior mentalizing abilities of female patients extend gender-related differences in schizophrenia to include social cognition. This suggests that our current knowledge of socio-cognitive abilities in schizophrenia is generalizable to male but not to female patients. The findings also provide important insights to understanding how etiological differences affect social cognition. Awareness to such differences has important implications for diagnosis and clinical treatment.\n",

            "PURPOSE: During their early years at medical school, students repeatedly criticize their workload, time constraints and test associated stress. At the same time, depressiveness and anxiety among first and second year medical students are on the rise. We therefore hypothesized that test anxiety may be related to depressiveness and considered cognitive and academic performances as confounders for the former and psychosocial distress for the latter. METHODS: A whole class of 200 second year students was invited to participate in the study. Anxiety as a trait, depressiveness, crystallized intelligence, verbal fluency and psychosocial distress were assessed using validated tests and questionnaires. Acute state anxiety and sympathetic stress parameters were measured in real life situations immediately before an oral and a written exam and paired tests were used to compare the individual anxieties at the various time points. Previous academic performances were self-reported, the results of the impending exams were monitored. Finally, correlations were performed to test for interrelatedness between academic performances and the various personal, cognitive and psychosocial factors. RESULTS: Acute test anxiety did not correlate with depressiveness nor did it correlate with previous nor impending academic performances nor any of the expected confounders on academic performance. However both, depressiveness and test anxiety strongly correlated with the perceived imbalance between efforts spent and rewards received. Moreover, anxiety as a trait not only correlated with acute state anxiety before an exam but was also significantly correlated to the feeling of over-commitment. CONCLUSION: Depressiveness during the early years of medical school seems unrelated to test anxiety and academic performance. Instead, it strongly correlated with the psychosocial distress emanating from attending medical school and points at a perceived imbalance between efforts spent and rewards received.\n",

We examined multiple seizure-related, demographic, and cognitive variables in a group of 93 pediatric patients with intractable seizures who were at risk for social skills deficits and social problems at home and in the classroom. Verbal intelligence and parental anxiety about epilepsy were found to be the two primary predictors of social functioning in children with epilepsy as reported by parents and teachers. Though other social variables and secondarily generalized seizures were significantly correlated with certain aspects of parent-reported social functioning, the impact of these variables appeared to be mediated through verbal intelligence and/or parental anxiety about epilepsy. These findings emphasize the importance of family characteristics on social functioning in children with epilepsy and also suggest that parental anxiety about their child's epilepsy may be a specific risk factor for this population. The findings from this study suggest that the factors associated with social functioning in children with epilepsy are similar regardless of whether social functioning is assessed by the parent or the classroom teacher.\n",

Bayesian regression models revealed that complex spatial abilities and in-class attention were the most plausible predictors of seventh-grade mathematics, but not word reading, achievement, controlling for prior achievement. These results were confirmed with multilevel models that revealed interactions between these factors and prior achievement. The largest gains were among students with strong mathematical competencies in sixth-grade, and average or better in-class attention in seventh-grade as well as above average spatial abilities. High mathematics anxiety was associated with lower attention and through this indirectly influenced achievement gains.

OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of AI-driven automated medical-history-taking systems with or without AI-driven differential-diagnosis lists on physicians' diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: This randomized controlled study was conducted in January 2021 and included 22 physicians working at a university hospital.

In Japan, the government is preparing for the rollout of AI in the medical industry. This rollout depends on doctors and the public accepting the technology. Therefore it is necessary to consider acceptance among doctors and among the public. However, little is known about the acceptance of AI in medicine in Japan. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to obtain detailed data on the acceptance of AI in medicine by comparing the acceptance among Japanese doctors with that among the Japanese public. METHODS: We conducted an online survey, and the responses of doctors and members of the public were compared. AI in medicine was defined as the use of AI to determine diagnosis and treatment without requiring a doctor. A questionnaire was prepared referred to as the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, a model of behavior toward new technologies. It comprises 20 items, and each item was rated on a five-point scale. Using this questionnaire, we conducted an online survey in 2018 among 399 doctors and 600 members of the public. The sample-wide responses were analyzed, and then the responses of the doctors were compared with those of the public using t tests. RESULTS: Regarding the sample-wide responses (N=999), 653 (65.4%) of the respondents believed, in the future, AI in medicine would be necessary, whereas only 447 (44.7%) expressed an intention to use AI-driven medicine. Additionally, 730 (73.1%) believed that regulatory legislation was necessary, and 734 (73.5%) were concerned about where accountability lies. Regarding the comparison between doctors and the public, doctors (mean 3.43, SD 1.00) were more likely than members of the public (mean 3.23, SD 0.92) to express intention to use AI-driven medicine (P<.001), suggesting that optimism about AI in medicine is greater among doctors compared to the public. CONCLUSIONS: Many of the respondents were optimistic about the role of AI in medicine. However, when asked whether they would like to use AI-driven medicine, they tended to give a negative response. This trend suggests that concerns about the lack of regulation and about accountability hindered acceptance. Additionally, the results revealed that doctors were more enthusiastic than members of the public regarding AI-driven medicine. For the successful implementation of AI in medicine, it would be necessary to inform the public and doctors about the relevant laws and to take measures to remove their concerns about them.\n",

            "OBJECTIVE: Although artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved high levels of accuracy in the diagnosis of various diseases, its impact on physicians' decision-making performance in clinical practice is uncertain. This study aims to assess the impact of AI on the diagnostic performance of physicians with differing levels of self-efficacy under working conditions involving different time pressures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 2 (independent diagnosis vs AI-assisted diagnosis) x 2 (no time pressure vs 2-minute time limit) randomized controlled experiment of multicenter physicians was conducted. Participants diagnosed 10 pulmonary adenocarcinoma cases and their diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were evaluated. Data analysis was performed using multilevel logistic regression. RESULTS: One hundred and four radiologists from 102 hospitals completed the experiment. The results reveal (1) AI greatly increases physicians' diagnostic accuracy, either with or without time pressure; (2) when no time pressure, AI significantly improves physicians' diagnostic sensitivity but no significant change in specificity, while under time pressure, physicians' diagnostic sensitivity and specificity are both improved with the aid of AI; (3) when no time pressure, physicians with low self-efficacy benefit from AI assistance thus improving diagnostic accuracy but those with high self-efficacy do not, whereas physicians with low and high levels of self-efficacy both benefit from AI under time pressure. DISCUSSION: This study is one of the first to provide real-world evidence regarding the impact of AI on physicians' decision-making performance, taking into account 2 boundary factors: clinical time pressure and physicians' self-efficacy.

The authors framed their analysis as an examination of the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis, which holds that the heritability of intelligence varies as a function of socioeconomic status. Pesta et al. concluded that the heritability of intelligence does not differ across racial and ethnic groups in the United States. They claimed their results challenge the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis and support the hereditarian position that mean differences in IQ among racial and ethnic groups are attributable to genetic differences rather than environmental disparities. In this commentary, we outline severe theoretical, methodological, and rhetorical flaws in every step of Pesta et al.'s meta-analysis. The most reliable finding from Pesta et al. is consistent with the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis and directly contradicts a hereditarian understanding of group differences in intelligence. Finally, we suggest that Pesta et al. serves as an example of how racially motivated and poorly executed work can find its way into a mainstream scientific journal, underscoring the importance of robust peer review and rigorous editorial judgment in the open-science era.\n",

One avenue that has been proposed to change this is to strengthen the interaction between artificial intelligence (AI) research and neuroscience. Since their historical beginnings, ANNs and AI, in general, have developed in close alignment with both neuroscience and psychology. In addition to deep learning, reinforcement learning (RL) is another approach that is strongly linked to AI and neuroscience to understand how learning is implemented in the brain. In a recently published article, Botvinick et al. (Neuron, 107:603-616, 2020) explain why deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is important for neuroscience as a framework to study learning, representations and decision making. Here, I summarise Botvinick et al.'s main arguments and frame them in the context of the study of learning, memory and spatial navigation. I believe that applying this approach to study spatial navigation can provide useful insights for the understanding of how the brain builds, processes and stores representations of the outside world to extract knowledge.\n",

            "One of the challenges in writing an article reviewing the current state of cyber education and workforce development is that there is a paucity of quantitative assessment regarding the cognitive aptitudes, work roles, or team organization required by cybersecurity professionals to be successful. In this review, we argue that the people who operate within the cyber domain need a combination of technical skills, domain specific knowledge, and social intelligence to be successful. They, like the networks they operate, must also be reliable, trustworthy, and resilient. Defining the knowledge, skills, attributes, and other characteristics is not as simple as defining a group of technical skills that people can be trained on; the complexity of the cyber domain makes this a unique challenge. There has been little research devoted to exactly what attributes individuals in the cyber domain need. What research does exist places an emphasis on technical and engineering skills while discounting the important social and organizational influences that dictate success or failure in everyday settings. This paper reviews the literature on cyber expertise and cyber workforce development to identify gaps and then argues for the important contribution of social fit in the highly complex and heterogenous cyber workforce. We then identify six assumptions for the future of cybersecurity workforce development, including the requirement for systemic thinkers, team players, a love for continued learning, strong communication ability, a sense of civic duty, and a blend of technical and social skill. Finally, we make recommendations for social and cognitive metrics which may be indicative of future performance in cyber work roles to provide a roadmap for future scholars.\n",

AI-based technologies and technique are now considered to have uses in almost every domain of mental health care: including decision-making, assessment and healthcare management. What remains underexplored is whether/how mental health recovery is situated within these discussions and practices. METHOD: Taking conversational agents as our point of departure, we explore the ways official online materials explain and make sense of chatbots, their imagined functionality and value for (potential) users. We focus on three chatbots for mental health: Woebot, Wysa and Tess. FINDINGS: \"Recovery\" is largely missing as an overt focus across materials. However, analysis does reveal themes that speak to the struggles over practice, expertise and evidence that the concept of recovery articulates. We discuss these under the headings \"troubled clinical responsibility\", \"extended virtue of (technological) self-care\" and \"altered ontologies and psychopathologies of time\". CONCLUSIONS: Ultimately, we argue that alongside more traditional forms of recovery, chatbots may be shaped by, and shaping, an increasingly individualised form of a \"personal recovery imperative\".\n",

In the domain of emotion, expertise refers to the observation that some people are better at a range of competencies related to understanding and experiencing emotions, and these competencies may help them lead healthier lives. These individual differences are represented by multiple constructs including emotional awareness, emotional clarity, emotional complexity, emotional granularity, and emotional intelligence. These constructs derive from different theoretical perspectives, highlight different competencies, and are operationalized and measured in different ways. The full set of relationships between these constructs has not yet been considered, hindering scientific progress and the translation of findings to aid mental and physical well-being. In this article, we use a scoping review procedure to integrate these constructs within a shared conceptual space. Scoping reviews provide a principled means of synthesizing large and diverse literature in a transparent fashion, enabling the identification of similarities as well as gaps and inconsistencies across constructs. Using domain-general accounts of expertise as a guide, we build a unifying framework for expertise in emotion and apply this to constructs that describe how people understand and experience their own emotions. Our approach offers opportunities to identify potential mechanisms of expertise in emotion, encouraging future research on those mechanisms and on educational or clinical interventions.

Research questions about this discrepancy have not been fully answered. This study applies artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to explore the complex network of factors and the cause-effect relationships affecting the place of death, with the ultimate aim of developing policies favouring home-based end-of-life care. METHODS: A data mining algorithm and a causal probabilistic model for data analysis were developed with information derived from expert knowledge that was merged with data from 116 deceased cancer patients in southern Switzerland. This data set was obtained via a retrospective clinical chart review. RESULTS: Dependencies of disease and treatment-related decisions demonstrate an influence on the place of death of 13%. Anticancer treatment in advanced disease prevents or delays communication about the end of life between oncologists, patients and families. Unknown preferences for the place of death represent a great barrier to a home death. A further barrier is the limited availability of family caregivers for terminal home care. The family's preference for the last place of care has a high impact on the place of death of 51%, while the influence of the patient's preference is low, at 14%. Approximately one-third of family systems can be empowered by health care professionals to provide home care through open end-of-life communication and good symptom management. Such intervention has an influence on the place of death of 17%. If families express a convincing preference for home care, the involvement of a specialist palliative home care service can increase the probability of home deaths by 24%. CONCLUSION: Concerning death at home, open communication about death and dying is essential. Furthermore, for the patient preference for home care to be respected, the family's decision for the last place of care seems to be key. The early initiation of family-centred palliative care and the provision of specialist palliative home care for patients who wish to die at home are suggested.\n",

The pandemic is the cause of significant mortality and with this the need for rapidly disseminated information for palliative care professionals regarding the prevalence of symptoms, their intensity, their resistance or susceptibility to symptom control and the mode of death for patients. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review of published evidence for symptoms in patients with COVID-19 (with a specific emphasis on symptoms at end of life) and on modes of death. Inclusion: prospective or retrospective studies detailing symptom presence and/or cause or mode of death from COVID-19. RESULTS: 12 papers met the inclusion criteria and gave details of symptom burden: four of these specifically in the dying and two detailed the cause or mode of death. Cough, breathlessness, fatigue and myalgia are significant symptoms in people hospitalised with COVID-19. Dyspnoea is the most significant symptom in the dying. The mode of death was described in two papers and is predominantly through respiratory or heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: There remains a dearth of information regarding symptom burden and mode of death to inform decisions regarding end-of-life care in patients dying with COVID-19. Rapid data gathering on the mode of death and the profile of symptoms in the dying and their prevalence and severity in areas where COVID-19 is prevalent will provide important intelligence for clinicians.

The study aimed to investigate the impact of DCP on place of death and hospital usage (emergency department (ED) and admissions). METHODS: Retrospective cohort of all eligible palliative patients who died over a 6-month period in two counties (n=3594). Participants were those who died of conditions considered to be eligible for end-of-life care, as defined by the Public Health England National End of Life Care Intelligence Network. The sample included people who did and did not access DCP services. DCP service, hospital admission and ED use data, demographic and death data were collected on all eligible participants. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, those using Delivering Choice were at least 30% less likely to die in hospital or have an emergency hospital admission or ED visit in the last 30 or 7 days of life than those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Recipients of DCP services were less likely to die in or use hospital services.

Although well founded critique on the conceptualization of emotional intelligence has emerged over the last years, studies about emotional intelligence - especially the ability-based approach by Mayer and Salovey - can persistently be found in schizophrenia research. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies published between October 2015 and October 2016 were included in this review. The majority of the studies addressed the associations between ability-based emotional intelligence and other clinical or neuropsychological features, for example symptom severity or executive functioning. One study investigated the effect of oxytocin on emotional intelligence and another dealt with the question, whether emotional intelligence could be an endophenotype for schizophrenia. SUMMARY: The reviewed literature reveals that patients with schizophrenia exhibit impairments in ability-based emotional intelligence. In this context, non-social cognition, positive symptoms, and anomalous-self experiences seem to be of major relevance. The potential endophenotypic role of ability-based emotional intelligence in schizophrenia remains to be clarified.\n",

Results showed that female offenders were impaired in the understanding and management of emotion relative to the general population, and that female offenders scored higher than male offenders in EI. Affective psychopathic traits (e.g., callousness) yielded a small relationship with difficulties in managing emotion in female offenders, and few gender differences in relationships between psychopathy and EI were found.

Research participants included 182 (89 mental and 93 medical) health-care professionals who completed an assessment battery measuring compassion fatigue, emotion management, trait emotional intelligence, situation-specific coping strategies, and negative affect. Major findings indicate that both self-report \"trait\" emotional intelligence and ability-based emotion management are inversely associated with compassion fatigue; adaptive coping is inversely related to compassion fatigue; and differences exist between mental and medical professions in emotional intelligence, coping strategies, and negative affect. Furthermore, problem-focused coping appears to mediate the association between trait emotional intelligence and compassion fatigue. These findings shed light on the role of emotional factors in compassion fatigue among health-care professionals. Beyond enhancing our knowledge of practitioners' professional quality of life, the current study serves as a basis for the early identification of groups of practitioners at risk for compassion fatigue.\n",

Combining these insights, we propose that emotional intelligence is a key mechanism in the so-called female leadership advantage (Eagly and Carli 2003-which emphasizes the finding that women are rated slightly higher in transformational leadership compared to men). The current study seeks to explain this gender leadership gap by specifying three personality-based theoretical mechanisms that enhance transformational leadership: (a) emotional intelligence (favoring women), (b) communion (stereotypical femininity; favoring women; Hsu et al. 2021), as well as an offsetting effect of (c) agency (stereotypical masculinity; favoring men). Meta-analytic data (including original meta-analyses among the leader's ability-based emotional intelligence, transformational leadership, communion, and agency) are used to test our theorized model. Results confirm the full mediation model of female leadership advantage. Because the three unique mechanisms operate in different directions, their individual indirect effects are notable, but their cumulative indirect effect is small and near-zero. In conclusion, we emphasize incorporating emotional intelligence with other personality-based explanations of gender effects in leadership perceptions.\n",

Nevertheless, explanations for this relationship in terms of underlying neurocognitive processes are still inadequate. This study addresses this issue using an individual differences approach in which Central Executive System (CES) and Short-Term Storage (STS) components of WM are measured comprehensively and examined for their relationship with g via event-related potentials components (P200 and P300) as mediators. Participants (n = 115) completed tests of the WM, CES and STS, as well as g. P200 and P300 components were recorded during 3-back WM task performance. Structural equation modelling showed significant negative associations between the P200 latency for target stimuli and CES shifting processes, and between the P300 amplitude for target stimuli and CES inhibition and updating processes. The relationship between CES processes and g was mediated in a localized fashion by the P300 amplitude. These findings further support the notion that the CES has a multidimensional structure and, importantly, reveal that the inhibition and updating functions of the CES are crucial in explaining the relationship between WM and g. Negative relations between ERP indices (P200 latency and P300 amplitude for target stimuli) and g support a neural efficiency hypothesis related to high intelligence.\n",

The present study replicated the Loring et al. study in a larger sample and extended their findings by examining the relationships among VSVT performance, FSIQ, and working memory. A total of 404 patients with medically intractable epilepsy completed a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Differences in WAIS-III and WMS-III performance were examined as a function of VSVT hard score categories as determined by Grote et al.

Quantile regression models were constructed to compare the strength of the relationship between FSIQ and VSVT at various points of the FSIQ distribution. Linear regression analyses examined working memory as a potential mediator between FSIQ and VSVT performance. The invalid group performed more poorly than the valid and questionable groups on multiple measures of intelligence and memory. The strength of the relationship between FSIQ and VSVT hard item performance decreased as FSIQ increased, and working memory mediated this relationship.

            "General cognitive ability, or general intelligence (g), is central to cognitive science, yet the processes that constitute it remain unknown, in good part because most prior work has relied on correlational methods. Large-scale behavioral and neuroanatomical data from neurologic patients with focal brain lesions can be leveraged to advance our understanding of the key mechanisms of g, as this approach allows inference on the independence of cognitive processes along with elucidation of their respective neuroanatomical substrates. We analyzed behavioral and neuroanatomical data from 402 humans (212 males; 190 females) with chronic, focal brain lesions. Structural equation models (SEMs) demonstrated a psychometric isomorphism between g and working memory in our sample (which we refer to as g/Gwm), but not between g and other cognitive abilities. Multivariate lesion-behavior mapping analyses indicated that g and working memory localize most critically to a site of converging white matter tracts deep to the left temporo-parietal junction. Tractography analyses demonstrated that the regions in the lesion-behavior map of g/Gwm were primarily associated with the arcuate fasciculus. The anatomic findings were validated in an independent cohort of acute stroke patients (n = 101) using model-based predictions of cognitive deficits generated from the Iowa cohort lesion-behavior maps. The neuroanatomical localization of g/Gwm provided the strongest prediction of observed g in the new cohort (r = 0.42, p < 0.001), supporting the anatomic specificity of our findings. These results provide converging behavioral and anatomic evidence that working memory is a key mechanism contributing to domain-general cognition.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT General cognitive ability (g) is thought to play an important role in individual differences in adaptive behavior, yet its core processes remain unknown, in large part because of difficulties in making causal inferences from correlated data.

The variability in the development of intelligence and language among individuals on the autism spectrum has long been acknowledged, but it remains unknown whether these differences impact on the neuropathology of ASD. In this study, we aimed to compare associations between surface-based regional brain measures and general intelligence (IQ) scores in ASD individuals with and without a history of language delay. We included 64 ASD adults of normal intelligence (37 without a history of language delay and 27 with a history of language delay and 80 neurotypicals). Regions with a significant association between verbal and nonverbal IQ and measures of cortical thickness (CT), surface area, and cortical volume were first identified in the combined sample of individuals with ASD and controls. Thicker dorsal frontal and temporal cortices, and thinner lateral orbital frontal and parieto-occipital cortices were associated with greater and lower verbal IQ scores, respectively. Correlations between cortical volume and verbal IQ were observed in similar regions as revealed by the CT analysis. A significant difference between ASD individuals with and without a history of language delay in the association between CT and verbal IQ was evident in the parieto-occipital region. These results indicate that ASD subgroups defined on the basis of differential language trajectories in childhood can have different associations between verbal IQ and brain measures in adulthood despite achieving similar levels of cognitive performance.\n",

This study examined the relationship between depression and cognitive ability, autism symptom severity, and self-reported social impairments in autism spectrum disorder. A total of 33 adults with autism spectrum disorder and 28 adults with typical development completed a standardized psychiatric interview, cognitive test, measure of clinician-rated autism symptom severity, and self-report of social impairments. Nine participants with autism spectrum disorder (27%) met the criteria for a depressive disorder (autism spectrum disorder + depressive disorder). Relatively more females with autism spectrum disorder had a co-occurring depressive disorder. The typical development group had a higher intelligence quotient than the autism spectrum disorder group, but the autism spectrum disorder + depressive disorder group did not differ from the typical development or autism spectrum disorder group. While the autism spectrum disorder + depressive disorder group had lower clinician-rated autism symptom severity than the autism spectrum disorder group, the autism spectrum disorder + depressive disorder group reported more social impairments than the autism spectrum disorder group. Self-reported social impairments predicted depression in adults with autism spectrum disorder when accounting for symptom severity and cognitive ability. These findings suggest that more self-perceived social impairments are related to depressive disorders in autism spectrum disorder, and may help clinicians identify individuals who are vulnerable in developing a co-occurring depressive disorder. Future directions include follow-up studies with larger cohorts and longitudinal designs to support inferences regarding directionality of these relationships.\n",

This picture changed over time with broadening the spectrum view. Within the present perspective article, we discuss discrepancies in IQ profiles between epidemiological and clinical studies and identify potential underlying aspects, for example, the influence of external factors such as sample biases or differences in availability of autism health services. Additionally, we discuss the validity and reciprocal influences of ASD diagnostics and IQ measurement. We put the impact of these factors for diagnostic as well as care and support situations of patients into perspective and want to encourage further research to contribute to the conceptualization of \"autism\" more comprehensively including the IQ as well as to examine broader (life) circumstances, interacting factors and diagnostic requirements of given diagnoses in childhood as compared to adulthood.\n",

Here we present a reanalysis of the data used by Lanphear et al. to evaluate the robustness of their conclusions. Our analysis differed from that of Lanphear et al. primarily in how we controlled for non-lead variables (allowing a number of them to be site-specific), how we defined summary measures of BPb exposure, and in how we decided which BPb measures and transformations best modeled the data. We also reproduced the Lanphear et al. analysis. Although we found some small errors and questionable decisions by Lanphear et al. that, taken alone, could cause doubt in their conclusions, our reanalysis tended to support their conclusions. We concluded that there was statistical evidence that the exposure-response is non-linear over the full range of BPb evaluated in these studies, which implies that, for a given increase in blood lead, the associated IQ decrement is greater at lower BPb levels. However at BPb below 10 microg/dL, the exposure-response is adequately modeled as linear.

However, this strategy has not been applied to human intelligence. Here we implemented a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using GDMs to assess the causal relationships between genetically determined metabolites and human intelligence.

Similarly, also dihomo-linoleate (20:2n6) and p-acetamidophenylglucuronide showed robust association with intelligence. Our study provides novel insight by integrating genomics and metabolomics to estimate causal effects of genetically determined metabolites on human intelligence, which help to understanding of the biological mechanisms related to human intelligence.\n",

            "A recent study by Dutton et al. (J Relig Health 59:1567-1579. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-019-00926-3 , 2020) found that the religiousness-IQ nexus is not on g when comparing different groups with various degrees of religiosity and the non-religious. It suggested, accordingly, that the nexus related to the relationship between specialized analytic abilities on the IQ test and autism traits, with the latter predicting atheism. The study was limited by the fact that it was on group-level data, it used only one measure of religiosity that measure may have been confounded by the social element to church membership and it involved relatively few items via which a Jensen effect could be calculated. Here, we test whether the religiousness-IQ nexus is on g with individual-level data using archival data from the Vietnam Experience Study, in which 4462 US veterans were subjected to detailed psychological tests. We used multiple measures of religiosity-which we factor-analysed to a religion-factor-and a large number of items. We found, contrary to the findings of Dutton et al. (2020), that the IQ differences with regard to whether or not subjects believed in God are indeed a Jensen effect. We also uncovered a number of anomalies, which we explore.\n",
