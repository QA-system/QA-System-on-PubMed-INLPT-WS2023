The focus on dropout rates in Health Sciences is due to several reasons:\\n\\n1. High stakes: Health Sciences programs are often highly competitive and have high admission standards. Students who enroll in these programs may feel pressure to succeed and may be more likely to drop out if they encounter difficulties or struggle with the coursework.\\n2. Cost: Health Sciences programs can be expensive, and students who drop out may leave with a significant amount of debt. This can be a financial burden that can impact their future career choices and opportunities.\\n3. Limited seats: Many Health Sciences programs have limited seats, which means that there may be more qualified applicants than available spots. This can create a high-pressure environment for students who are accepted into these programs, and may contribute to higher dropout rates.\\n4. Complex curriculum: Health Sciences programs often have complex and demanding curricula, which can be challenging for some students to navigate. This can lead to feelings of overwhelm and burnout, which may contribute to higher dropout rates.\\n5. Personal circumstances: Some students may experience personal circumstances that make it difficult for them to continue their studies, such as health issues, family obligations, or financial struggles. These factors can contribute to higher dropout rates in Health Sciences programs.\\n\\nOverall, the focus on dropout rates in Health Sciences is due to the high stakes involved in these programs, the cost of tuition, the limited number of seats available, the complexity of the curriculum, and the potential impact of personal circumstances on students' ability to complete their studies.\""

              "[Document(page_content='Female breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the world. Several efforts in artificial intelligence have been made to help improving the diagnostic accuracy at earlier stages. However, the identification of breast abnormalities, like masses, on mammographic images is not a trivial task, especially for dense breasts. In this paper we describe our novel mass detection process that includes three successive steps of enhancement, characterization and classification. The proposed enhancement system is based mainly on the analysis of the breast texture. First of all, a filtering step with morphological operators and soft thresholding is achieved. Then, we remove from the filtered breast region, all the details that may interfere with the eventual masses, including pectoral muscle and galactophorous tree. The pixels belonging to this tree will be interpolated and replaced by the average of the neighborhood. In the characterization process, measurement of the Gaussian density in the wavelet domain allows the segmentation of the masses. Finally, a comparative classification mechanism based on the Bayesian regularization back-propagation networks and ANFIS techniques is proposed. The tests were conducted on the MIAS database. The results showed the robustness of the proposed enhancement method.'),\n",

However, only a few industrial applications are described in the literature. In this paper, an object detection application for visual quality evaluation of X-ray scatter grids is described and evaluated. To detect the small defects on the 4K input images, a sliding window approach is chosen. A special characteristic of the selected approach is the aggregation of overlapping prediction results by applying a 2D scalar field. The final system is able to detect 90% of the relevant defects, taking a precision score of 25% into account. A practical examination of the effectiveness elaborates the potential of the approach, improving the detection results of the inspection process by over 13%.'),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"BACKGROUND: Improved breast cancer risk assessment models are needed to enable personalized screening strategies that achieve better harm-to-benefit ratio based on earlier detection and better breast cancer outcomes than existing screening guidelines. Computational mammographic phenotypes have demonstrated a promising role in breast cancer risk prediction. With the recent exponential growth of computational efficiency, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, driven by the introduction of deep learning, has expanded the utility of imaging in predictive models. Consequently, AI-based imaging-derived data has led to some of the most promising tools for precision breast cancer screening. MAIN BODY: This review aims to synthesize the current state-of-the-art applications of AI in mammographic phenotyping of breast cancer risk. We discuss the fundamentals of AI and explore the computing advancements that have made AI-based image analysis essential in refining breast cancer risk assessment. Specifically, we discuss the use of data derived from digital mammography as well as digital breast tomosynthesis. Different aspects of breast cancer risk assessment are targeted including (a) robust and reproducible evaluations of breast density, a well-established breast cancer risk factor, (b) assessment of a woman's inherent breast cancer risk, and (c) identification of women who are likely to be diagnosed with breast cancers after a negative or routine screen due to masking or the rapid and aggressive growth of a tumor. Lastly, we discuss AI challenges unique to the computational analysis of mammographic imaging as well as future directions for this promising research field. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a useful reference for AI researchers investigating image-based breast cancer risk assessment while indicating key priorities and challenges that, if properly addressed, could accelerate the implementation of AI-assisted risk stratification to future refine and individualize breast cancer screening strategies.\"),\n",
              " Document(page_content='(Aim) Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the second most common cancer worldwide. With the rapid advancement of deep learning, the early stages of breast cancer development can be accurately detected by radiologists with the help of artificial intelligence systems. (Method) Based on mammographic imaging, a mainstream clinical breast screening technique, we present a diagnostic system for accurate classification of breast abnormalities based on ResNet-50. To improve the proposed model, we created a new data augmentation framework called SCDA (Scaling and Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization Data Augmentation). In its procedure, we first conduct the scaling operation to the original training set, followed by applying contrast limited adaptive histogram equalisation (CLAHE) to the scaled training set. By stacking the training set after SCDA with the original training set, we formed a new training set. The network trained by the augmented training set, was coined as ResNet-SCDA-50. Our system, which aims at a binary classification on mammographic images acquired from INbreast and MINI-MIAS, classifies masses, microcalcification as \"abnormal\", while normal regions are classified as \"normal\". (Results) We present the first attempt to use the image contrast enhancement method as the data augmentation method, resulting in an averaged 98.55 percent specificity and 92.83 percent sensitivity, which gives our best model an overall accuracy of 95.74 percent. (Conclusion) Our proposed method is effective in classifying breast abnormality.')]"

However, the identification of breast abnormalities, like masses, on mammographic images is not a trivial task, especially for dense breasts. In this paper we describe our novel mass detection process that includes three successive steps of enhancement, characterization and classification. The proposed enhancement system is based mainly on the analysis of the breast texture. First of all, a filtering step with morphological operators and soft thresholding is achieved. Then, we remove from the filtered breast region, all the details that may interfere with the eventual masses, including pectoral muscle and galactophorous tree. The pixels belonging to this tree will be interpolated and replaced by the average of the neighborhood. In the characterization process, measurement of the Gaussian density in the wavelet domain allows the segmentation of the masses. Finally, a comparative classification mechanism based on the Bayesian regularization back-propagation networks and ANFIS techniques is proposed. The tests were conducted on the MIAS database. The results showed the robustness of the proposed enhancement method.\n",

A special characteristic of the selected approach is the aggregation of overlapping prediction results by applying a 2D scalar field. The final system is able to detect 90% of the relevant defects, taking a precision score of 25% into account.

            "BACKGROUND: Improved breast cancer risk assessment models are needed to enable personalized screening strategies that achieve better harm-to-benefit ratio based on earlier detection and better breast cancer outcomes than existing screening guidelines. Computational mammographic phenotypes have demonstrated a promising role in breast cancer risk prediction. With the recent exponential growth of computational efficiency, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, driven by the introduction of deep learning, has expanded the utility of imaging in predictive models. Consequently, AI-based imaging-derived data has led to some of the most promising tools for precision breast cancer screening. MAIN BODY: This review aims to synthesize the current state-of-the-art applications of AI in mammographic phenotyping of breast cancer risk. We discuss the fundamentals of AI and explore the computing advancements that have made AI-based image analysis essential in refining breast cancer risk assessment. Specifically, we discuss the use of data derived from digital mammography as well as digital breast tomosynthesis. Different aspects of breast cancer risk assessment are targeted including (a) robust and reproducible evaluations of breast density, a well-established breast cancer risk factor, (b) assessment of a woman's inherent breast cancer risk, and (c) identification of women who are likely to be diagnosed with breast cancers after a negative or routine screen due to masking or the rapid and aggressive growth of a tumor. Lastly, we discuss AI challenges unique to the computational analysis of mammographic imaging as well as future directions for this promising research field. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a useful reference for AI researchers investigating image-based breast cancer risk assessment while indicating key priorities and challenges that, if properly addressed, could accelerate the implementation of AI-assisted risk stratification to future refine and individualize breast cancer screening strategies.\n",

            "(Aim) Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the second most common cancer worldwide. With the rapid advancement of deep learning, the early stages of breast cancer development can be accurately detected by radiologists with the help of artificial intelligence systems. (Method) Based on mammographic imaging, a mainstream clinical breast screening technique, we present a diagnostic system for accurate classification of breast abnormalities based on ResNet-50. To improve the proposed model, we created a new data augmentation framework called SCDA (Scaling and Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization Data Augmentation). In its procedure, we first conduct the scaling operation to the original training set, followed by applying contrast limited adaptive histogram equalisation (CLAHE) to the scaled training set. By stacking the training set after SCDA with the original training set, we formed a new training set. The network trained by the augmented training set, was coined as ResNet-SCDA-50. Our system, which aims at a binary classification on mammographic images acquired from INbreast and MINI-MIAS, classifies masses, microcalcification as \"abnormal\", while normal regions are classified as \"normal\". (Results) We present the first attempt to use the image contrast enhancement method as the data augmentation method, resulting in an averaged 98.55 percent specificity and 92.83 percent sensitivity, which gives our best model an overall accuracy of 95.74 percent. (Conclusion) Our proposed method is effective in classifying breast abnormality.\n",

        "ROUGE measures the similarity between the machine-generated summary and the reference summaries using overlapping n-grams, word sequences that appear in both the machine-generated summary and the reference summaries. The most common n-grams used are unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. ROUGE score calculates the recall of n-grams in the machine-generated summary by comparing them to the reference summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "**ROUGE-N:** ROUGE-N measures the overlap of n-grams (contiguous sequences of n words) between the candidate text and the reference text. It computes the precision, recall, and F1-score based on the n-gram overlap. For example, ROUGE-1 (unigram) measures the overlap of single words, ROUGE-2 (bigram) measures the overlap of two-word sequences, and so on. ROUGE-N is often used to evaluate the grammatical correctness and fluency of generated text.\n",
        "\n",
        "**ROUGE-L:** ROUGE-L measures the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the candidate text and the reference text. It computes the precision, recall, and F1-score based on the length of the LCS. ROUGE-L is often used to evaluate the semantic similarity and content coverage of generated text, as it considers the common subsequence regardless of word order.\n",
        "\n",
        "**ROUGE-S:** ROUGE-S measures the skip-bigram (bi-gram with at most one intervening word) overlap between the candidate text and the reference text. It computes the precision, recall, and F1-score based on the skip-bigram overlap. ROUGE-S is often used to evaluate the coherence and local cohesion of generated text, as it captures the semantic similarity between adjacent words.\n",
