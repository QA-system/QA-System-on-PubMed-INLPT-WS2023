      "1. Q: What is the purpose of the study?\n",
      "   A: The purpose of the study is to define the neuropsychological profile of children with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), with a focus on executive functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Q: How many children with BECTS and healthy children were enrolled in the study?\n",
      "   A: Fifteen school-aged children with BECTS and fifteen healthy children were enrolled in the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Q: What domains showed significant differences between patients with BECTS and healthy controls?\n",
      "   A: Significant differences were observed in the domains of language, executive functions, and academic skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Q: What are the implications of the study findings?\n",
      "   A: The study findings suggest that children with new-onset BECTS may experience difficulties in executive attention, language, and academic skills, despite having a normal IQ, low frequency of sleep discharges, and the absence of medication. Early assessment and intervention targeting executive functions are recommended to prevent persistent academic difficulties.\n",

      "1. Q: What is the purpose of the London Child Health and Development Study?\n",
      "   A: The purpose of the London Child Health and Development Study is to identify potential targets for early preventative intervention in children who display premorbid risk markers for schizophrenia.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Q: What are some findings from the CHADS study?\n",
      "   A: The CHADS study found that children who are at risk for schizophrenia displayed greater exposure and responsivity to stressors, impairments in general intelligence and specific cognitive functions, brain structure and function abnormalities, and neuromotor dysfunction.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Q: What percentage of 9-11-year olds were identified as being at-risk for psychosis in the CHADS study?\n",
      "   A: Approximately 9% of the 9-11-year olds in the CHADS study were identified as being at-risk for psychosis, as they displayed a triad of antecedents of schizophrenia, including psychotic-like experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Q: What is a potential target for intervention in at-risk children according to the CHADS study?\n",
      "   A: The CHADS study suggests that distressing psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) could be a viable target for cognitive-behavioral intervention in at-risk children.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Q: What is the core hypothesis in developmental theory regarding gene x socioeconomic status interaction on intelligence and academic achievement?\n",
      "   A: The core hypothesis in developmental theory predicts that genetic influences on intelligence and academic achievement are suppressed under conditions of socioeconomic privation and more fully realized under conditions of socioeconomic advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Q: What did the meta-analysis of tests of Gene x SES interaction on intelligence and academic-achievement test scores reveal in U.S. studies?\n",
      "   A: The meta-analysis showed clear support for moderately sized Gene x SES effects in U.S. studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Q: What were the findings of Gene x SES effects in studies from Western Europe and Australia?\n",
      "   A: In studies from Western Europe and Australia, where social policies ensure more uniform access to high-quality education and health care, Gene x SES effects were either zero or reversed.\n",

      "1. Q: What were previously considered principal determinants of cognition development?\n",
      "   A: Hypothyroidism and iodine deficiency.\n",

      "2. Q: What are some additional factors relevant to cognition?\n",
      "   A: Nutrition, infection, prenatal stress, and early life stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Q: Is thyroid function the only determinant of cognition?\n",
      "   A: No, cognition is influenced by many determinants, not just thyroid function.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Q: What is emotional intelligence and how does it affect human adaptability and psychosocial functioning? \n",
      "   A: Emotional intelligence is a set of emotional competencies that determine the effectiveness of human behaviors. It has a significant impact on human adaptability and the efficiency of psychosocial functioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Q: What were the findings of the research on psychological gender and emotional intelligence in female soccer players? \n",
      "   A: The analysis of the results showed that most female soccer players in the study had an androgynous psychological gender and a significantly higher level of emotional intelligence compared to other participants. This indicates a greater adaptability. However, the level of emotional intelligence in some players was average or low, suggesting a need for adequate intervention measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Q: What tools were used in the research on psychological gender and emotional intelligence in female soccer players? \n",
      "   A: The research used the Gender Assessment Inventory (IPP) and the Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (INTE) to assess psychological gender and emotional intelligence, respectively.\n",
