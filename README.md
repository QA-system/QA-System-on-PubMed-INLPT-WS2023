### Topic
Question Answering (QA) system：Use subset of PubMed dataset to create a system to answer questions about the data in natural language. For example:  
**Q:** How does the use of external spatial configurations in a click-and-drag version of the Raven Advanced Progressive Matrices test enhance the prediction of academic achievement in university students？      
**A:** The use of external spatial configurations in a click-and-drag version of the Raven Advanced Progressive Matrices test enhances the prediction of academic achievement in university students by allowing them to create different external spatial configurations while solving the puzzles, which leads to better understanding of the test and its questions.
